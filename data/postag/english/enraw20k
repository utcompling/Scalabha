Administration
officials
insist
that
the
size
of
the
staff
was
n't
a
problem
during
the
Panama
crisis
.
###
But
one
clear
problem
during
the
coup
attempt
was
that
the
NSC
staffer
most
experienced
in
Latin
America
,
Everett
Briggs
,
was
gone
.
###
He
had
just
resigned
,
at
least
in
part
because
of
a
feud
with
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Bernard
Aronson
over
the
administration
's
policy
on
Panama
and
support
for
Nicaragua
's
Contra
rebels
.
###
The
absence
of
Mr.
Briggs
underscored
the
possible
inadequacy
of
the
current
NSC
staff
.
###
Both
Gen.
Scowcroft
and
his
deputy
,
Robert
Gates
,
are
experts
in
U.S.-Soviet
affairs
.
###
Gen.
Scowcroft
is
particularly
well-versed
in
arms
control
,
and
Mr.
Gates
has
spent
years
studying
Soviet
politics
and
society
.
###
Both
have
become
confidants
of
President
Bush
.
###
But
neither
has
an
extensive
background
in
Latin
America
,
the
Middle
East
or
Asia
.
###
In
those
areas
,
the
role
of
NSC
staffers
under
them
therefore
have
become
more
important
.
###
Gen.
Scowcroft
knows
as
well
as
anyone
that
one
of
the
biggest
dangers
he
faces
is
that
NSC
staffers
working
in
relative
anonymity
will
take
over
policy-making
and
operational
tasks
that
are
best
left
to
bigger
and
more
experienced
State
Department
and
Pentagon
bureaus
.
###
But
just
as
every
previous
NSC
adviser
has
,
Gen.
Scowcroft
now
will
have
to
mull
at
what
point
the
NSC
staff
becomes
too
lean
and
too
restrained
.

A

Corp.
marketing
executive
,
admitting
his
role
in
the
Pentagon
procurement
scandal
,
pleaded
guilty
to
bribery
and
conspiracy
charges
for
helping
funnel
$
400,000
to
a
midlevel
Navy
acquisition
official
during
the
early
1980s
.
###
Frank
Lavelle
,
who
at
the
time
was
the
marketing
director
for
Sperry
in
Clearwater
,
Fla.
,
admitted
participating
in
a
scheme
to
bribe
Garland
Tomlin
,
the
Navy
official
.
###
Mr.
Tomlin
,
who
left
the
Navy
in
1985
,
pleaded
guilty
earlier
this
year
to
related
conspiracy
,
bribery
and
tax-evasion
charges
.
###
The
bribery
scheme
took
place
between
1982
and
1985
,
according
to
documents
filed
by
prosecutors
in
connection
with
Mr.
Lavelle
's
guilty
plea
in
federal
district
court
in
Alexandria
,

###
Sperry
merged
with
Burroughs
Corp.
to
become
Unisys
Corp.
in
late
1986
.
###
Court
documents
filed
by
prosecutors
indicate
Mr.
Tomlin
tried
to
steer
to
Sperry
a
multimillion
dollar
contract
to
computerize
maintenance
of
certain
Navy
electronics
equiment
.
###
Mr.
Tomlin
,
among
other
things
,
illegally
provided
Mr.
Lavelle
with
inside
information
and
documents
intended
to
give
Sperry
an
unfair
advantage
in
the
competition
,
the
documents
said
.
###
Sperry
ultimately
was
eliminated
from
the
competition
without
receiving
the
work
.
###
Documents
filed
by
prosecutors
also
indicate
that
Mr.
Lavelle
and
his
fellow
conspirators
requested
and
obtained
``
approval
of
the
scheme
''
from
more-senior
Sperry
officials
``
because
the
payment
which
-LCB-
Mr

requested

so
large

###
Bureaucrats
may
deserve
their
bad
reputation
,
after
all
.
###
Matthew
Lesko
,
something
of
a
professional
defender
of
government
,
thought
he
had
a
sure-fire
winner
last
summer
when
he
offered
$
5,000
for
the
best
``
verifiable
story
of
250
words
or
less
about
how
a
government
bureaucrat
helped
you
.
''
###
He
sent
out
thousands
of
news
releases
from
his
Kensington
,
Md.
,
office
.
###
He
plugged
the
contest
on
Larry
King
's
radio
show
,
on
Pat
Sajak
's
television
show
and
on
the
C-SPAN
cable
television
network
.
###
He
talked
about
it
in
every
speech
he
made
as
he
roamed
the
country
promoting
his
books
,
which
dispense
handy
how-to
advice
on
using
government
information
for
fun
and
profit
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
figured
he
would
be
flooded
with
entries
by
now
.
###
After
all
,
he
says
,
``
we
've
got
like
15
million
bureaucrats
.
''
###
And
in
addition
to
the
$
5,000
,
he
has
promised
the
winner
a
``
My
Favorite
Bureaucrat
''
plaque
and
offered
each
of
two
runners-up
$
500
.
###
So
far
,
though
,
Mr.
Lesko
has
received
only
one
entry
.
###
To
make
matters
worse
,
the
lone
nomination
came
from
another
bureaucrat
:
A
woman
from
the
New
York
State
Department
of
Taxation
and
Finance
who
nominated
her
boss
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
,
who
is
making
the
rules
as
he
goes
,
has
determined
that
bureaucrats
are
eligible
for
nomination
by
other
bureaucrats
.
###
But
he
says
he
would
prefer
to
get
nominations
from
rank-and-file
folks
.
###
He
admits
that
he
has
n't
had
much
luck
generating
free
publicity
for
his
contest
.
###
Newspapers
,
including
this
one
,
have
generally
ignored
his
news
releases
.
###
Talk
show
hosts
quickly
change
the
topic
.
###
But
Mr.
Lesko
's
staff
is
beginning
to
wonder
whether
there
is
n't
some
larger
phenomenon
foiling
the
contest
.
###
``
Is
the
government
not
helping
anybody
?
''
asks
Toni
Murray
,
an
assistant
to
Mr.
Lesko
.
###
Mr.
Lesko
himself
is
n't
yet
prepared
to
accept
that
explanation
.
###
``
People
hate
to
write
,
''
he
says
.
###
``
Maybe
people
do
n't
believe
I
want
to
give
this
money
away
.
''
###
Maybe
Americans
are
just
so
annoyed
with
government
that
they
are
n't
interested
in
admitting
that
bureaucrats
come
in
handy
once
in
a
while
.
###
If
he
sponsored
a
contest
on
how
a
bureaucrat
mishandled
something
,
Mr.
Lesko
admits
,
``
I
'd
get
5,000
entries
.
''
###
Now
there
's
an
idea
.
###
Ford
Motor
Co.
and
Saab-Scania
AB
of
Sweden
broke
off
talks
about
a
possible
alliance
after
Ford
officials
concluded
that
the
cost
to
modernize
Saab
's
car
operations
would
outweigh
the
likely
return
.
###
With
the
collapse
of
the
talks
Friday
,
European
analysts
expect
Ford
to
intensify
its
pursuit
of
British
luxury
car
maker
Jaguar
PLC
,
which
is
scrambling
to
fend
off
a
hostile
Ford
bid
by
negotiating
a
friendly
alliance
with
Ford
's
archrival
,
General
Motors
Corp
.
###
Saab
,
meanwhile
,
is
left
to
continue
its
search
for
an
ally
to
shore
up
its
sagging
car
business
.
###
Saab
said
last
week
it
``
has
had
and
will
continue
to
have
contacts
with
other
manufacturers
.
''
###
Among
the
possible
suitors
is
Italy
's
Fiat
S.p
.
A
,
analysts
said
last
week
.
###
Ford
and
Saab
officials
declined
to
elaborate
publicly
on
the
announcement
Friday
that
their
negotiations
failed
to
yield
an
agreement
``
that
could
make
long-term
business
sense
to
both
parties
.
''
###
Individuals
close
to
the
Ford
side
of
the
negotiations
said
late
last
week
that
the
No.
2
U.S.
auto
maker
lost
interest
as
it
became
clear
that
the
Swedish
auto
maker
's
automotive
operations
had
little
to
offer
in
the
way
of
image
or
technology
.
###
Ford
originally
had
seen
a
Saab
alliance
as
a
way
to
expand
its
presence
in
the
European
and
U.S.
luxury
car
markets
.
###
In
addition
,
Ford
and
Saab
had
discussed
a
possible
link
between
their
heavy
truck
operations
.
###
But
the
talks
on
a
heavy
truck
alliance
apparently
did
n't
go
far
.
###
Some
European
analysts
speculated
that
officials
of
Saab
's
highly
profitable
Scania
truck
operation
balked
at
surrendering
any
of
their
autonomy
.
###
Meanwhile
,
Ford
officials
became
convinced
they
could
n't
expect
to
recover
the
investment
it
would
require
to
make
Saab
's
cars
competitive
in
the
increasingly
crowded
luxury
market
.
###
Saab
's
problems
were
underscored
Friday
when
the
company
announced
that
its
car
division
had
a
1.2
billion
kronor
-LRB-
$
186.1
million
-RRB-
loss
during
the
first
eight
months
of
this
year
,
slightly
worse
than
Saab-Scania
had
forecast
in
its
first-half
report
last
month
.
###
Overall
,
Saab-Scania
's
pretax
profit
during
the
first
eight
months
of
the
year
plunged
48.9
%
to
1
billion
Swedish
kronor
-LRB-
$
155.1
million
-RRB-
from
1.96
billion
kronor
-LRB-
$
303.9
million
-RRB-
a
year
earlier
.
###
Industry
analysts
in
Europe
said
the
most
likely
suitor
for
Saab
now
is
Fiat
.
###
Saab
and
Fiat
have
worked
together
in
the
past
,
in
one
case
developing
jointly
a
new
auto
chassis
that
became
the
foundation
of
Saab
's
9000
model
,
Fiat
's
Croma
and
Lancia
's
Thema
.
###
Last
month
,
Saab-Scania
Chief
Executive
Georg
Karnsund
said
his
company
has
had
talks
with
Fiat
about
a
broader
alliance
.
###
But
the
talks
yielded
``
nothing
so
advanced
that
we
needed
to
make
a
public
announcement
about
it
,
''
he
said
.
###
As
for
Ford
,
analysts
expect
the
end
of
the
Saab
play
will
allow
the
U.S.
auto
maker
to
focus
its
resources
on
the
intensifying
struggle
with
GM
for
a
stake
in
Jaguar
.
###
The
failure
of
the
Saab
talks
``
makes
it
even
more
crucial
for
-LCB-
Ford
-RCB-
to
be
victorious
''
in
the
Jaguar
contest
,
said
Stephen
Reitman
,
European
auto
industry
analyst
at
UBS-Phillips
&
Drew
in
London
.
###
Ford
faces
an
uphill
fight
for
Jaguar
,
however
.
###
Jaguar
executives
said
last
week
they
expect
to
have
a
friendly
alliance
with
GM
wrapped
up
by
the
end
of
the
month
.
###
GM
,
meanwhile
,
is
hosting
a
delegation
of
members
of
the
British
Parliament
who
are
touring
the
auto
maker
's
headquarter
operations
in
Detroit
.
###
A
GM
spokesman
said
the
visit
is
n't
connected
to
the
Jaguar
situation
.
###
But
Ford
clearly
views
Jaguar
as
a
prize
worth
fighting
for
,
since
the
company
's
gilded
brand
image
would
give
Ford
a
badly
needed
leg
up
in
the
high
end
of
the
luxury
markets
in
both
Europe
and
the
U.S
.
###
Last
week
,
Ford
encountered
a
setback
in
its
effort
to
broaden
its
U.S.
luxury
offerings
when
it
was
forced
to
abandon
a
four-year-old
effort
to
market
its
German-built
Scorpio
sedan
in
the
U.S.
as
a
luxury
import
under
the
Merkur
brand
name
.
###
So
despite
the
GM-Jaguar
romance
,
analysts
say
Ford
by
last
Friday
had
boosted
its
Jaguar
holding
to
about
11
%
of
the
luxury
auto
maker
's
shares
outstanding
from
10.4
%
early
last
week
.
###
About
5.4
million
Jaguar
shares
changed
hands
in
active
trading
on
London
's
stock
exchange
Friday
,
and
Jaguar
shares
moved
up
19
pence
to
696
pence
-LRB-
$
11
-RRB-
.
###
On
the
U.S.
over-the-counter
market
,
Jaguar
's
American
depositary
receipts
rose
12.5
cents
to
$
11.125

The
Dallas
Cowboys
are
looking
at
a
long-yardage
situation
,
struggling
to
pull
ahead
of
the
Atlanta
Falcons
.
###
Up
in
his
stadium
box
,
their
new
and
controversial
owner
,
Jerral
``
Jerry
''
Jones
,
watches
anxiously
as
the
team
bounds
up
to
the
scrimmage
line
.
###
Mr.
Jones
takes
heart
.
###
There
in
the
center
of
the
pack
is
quarterback
Troy
Aikman
,
the
key
to
the
Cowboys
'
comeback
strategy
.
###
So
key
,
in
fact
,
that
Mr.
Jones
signed
him
in
April
for
$
11.4
million
over
the
next
six
years
--
a
record
for
a
rookie
.
###
``
He
's
a
genuine
Wheaties-box
athlete
,
''
gushes
Mr.
Jones
.
###
With
three
minutes
left
on
the
clock
,
Mr.
Aikman
takes
the
snap
,
steps
back
and
fires
a
21-yard
pass
--
straight
into
the
hands
of
an
Atlanta
defensive
back
.
###
The
crowd
groans
,
Mr.
Jones
shakes
his
head
,
the
Cowboys
lose
the
game
.
###
A
few
days
after
that
Sept.
17
game
,
Mr.
Aikman
broke
a
finger
,
sidelining
him
for
weeks
.
###
Ah
,
the
glamour
of
professional
sports
.
###
For
Mr.
Jones
,
losing
his
quarterback
temporarily
was
just
the
latest
in
a
string
of
setbacks
that
has
beset
the
Dallas
Cowboys
--
and
,
this
year
,
much
of
the
National
Football
League
.
###
Once
fat
and
happy
,
the
Cowboys
now
are
losing
games
,
fans
and
money
.
###
Last
year
,
the
team
ended
up
$
2
million
in
the
red
on
$
30
million
in
revenue
.
###
It
has
some
of
the
highest
costs
in
the
league
.
###
Its
attendance
is
off
23
%
from
six
years
ago
.
###
At
the
very
least
,
Mr.
Jones
,
who
cultivates
the
society
circuit
as
eagerly
as
his
bench
,
can
take
comfort
in
one
fact
:
These
days
,
he
is
n't
alone
.
###
Nearly
half
the
owners
of
the
28
National
Football
League
teams
are
losing
money
,
the
result
of
flat
attendance
,
aging
stadiums
and
--
more
than
anything
--
skyrocketing
salaries
for
star
players
like
Mr.
Aikman
.
###
Last
year
,
the
top
12
players
on
each
NFL
team
took
home
an
average
$
536,000
,
a
figure
comparable
to
baseball
and
higher
than
in
basketball
.
###
First-round
draft
picks
have
done
even
better
:
Average
salaries
and
bonuses
for
them
rose
to
$
685,000
this
year
,
up
44
%
from
1987
.
###
``
It
's
a
vicious
circle
,
''
says
Art
Modell
,
owner
of
the
Cleveland
Browns
.
###
``
One
team
pays
so
much
and
the
other
pays
more
.
###
We
just
do
n't
have
that
kind
of
income
stream
.
''
###
All
this
is
causing
convulsions
in
professional
football
.
###
Owners
,
largely
complacent
in
the
past
,
are
now
almost
desperately
looking
for
ways
to
lower
costs
and
raise
revenue
--
embracing
some
revolutionary
ideas
in
the
process
.
###
Though
not
intentionally
,
the
Cowboys
'
Mr.
Jones
has
come
to
represent
this
new
breed
of
owner
.
###
Shortly
after
buying
66
%
of
the
team
from
H.R.
``
Bum
''
Bright
for
$
145
million
,
and
mindful
of
the
Cowboys
'
ragged
bottom
line
,
the
47-year-old
Mr.
Jones
set
about
his
own
round
of
team
cuts
.
###
First
,
he
unceremoniously
sacked
Tom
Landry
,
the
legendary
coach
who
took
the
Cowboys
to
five
Super
Bowls
and
20
consecutive
winning
seasons
.
###
In
Dallas
,
Mr.
Landry
has
a
standing
just
shy
of
sainthood
.
###
Anti-Jones
sentiment
flooded
the
local
press
:
``
A
crude
obnoxious
hick
,
''
said
one
writer
;
``
a
real
oink
,
''
said
another
;
``
Who
in
the
hell
does
he
think
he
is
?
''
wrote
a
third
.
###
For
Mr.
Jones
,
it
was
just
the
beginning
.
###
He
quickly
cut
the
team
's
bloated
administrative
staff
by
half
,
shut
down
a
Cowboys-owned
dance
academy
and
,
in
July
,
announced
plans
to
sell
Valley
Ranch
,
the
team
's
30-acre
practice
camp
and
the
most
lavish
training
facility
in
the
NFL
.
###
Mr.
Jones
calls
the
ranch
``
the
Pentagon
of
Sportdom
.
''
###
It
is
a
maze
of
halls
that
connects
film
rooms
,
elaborate
spas
and
weight-training
centers
that
testify
to
a
richer
,
more
free-spending
era
.
###
He
likes
to
tell
the
yarn
of
how
he
got
lost
on
the
expansive
ranch
during
an
early
visit
,
took
refuge
in
an
office
and
called
the
front
desk
for
help
.
###
``
I
said
,
`
Somebody
come
get
me
.
###
I
'm
at
extension
29
.
'
''
###
With
a
new
day
dawning
on
the
sport
,
Mr.
Jones
does
n't
see
a
place
for
this
sort
of
luxury
.
###
``
It
's
just
not
cost
efficient
,
''
he
says
.
###
The
place
costs
nearly
$
2
million
a
year
to
maintain
.
###
When
he
sells
it
,
he
says
,
the
Cowboys
will
move
to
a
more
practical
--
read
affordable
--
grass
practice
field
near
Texas
Stadium
.
###
And
as
for
Tom
Landry
,
well
,
in
Mr.
Jones
's
mind
,
he
had
played
out
his
winning
years
.
###
After
posting
losing
seasons
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
,
the
Cowboys
needed
a
change
,
he
says
.
###
Football
has
long
been
Mr.
Jones
's
passion
,
both
on
and
off
the
field
.
###
An
Arkansas
native
,
he
started
at
guard
on
the
undefeated
1964
University
of
Arkansas
team
that
won
a
national
championship
.
###
After
college
,
he
worked
at
his
father
's
insurance
company
in
Little
Rock
,
and
in
1966
led
an
aborted
attempt
to
buy
the
San
Diego
Chargers
.
###
Years
later
,
with
cash
from
the
sale
of
the
insurance
company
,
he
founded
Arkoma
Production
Corp.
,
an
oil
and
gas
exploration
company
based
in
Little
Rock
.
###
So
it
was
n't
surprising
that
Mr.
Jones
returned
to
his
Arkansas
roots
when
he
went
looking
for
a
replacement
for
Mr.
Landry
.
###
He
tapped
Jimmy
Johnson
,
a
teammate
on
the
1964
University
of
Arkansas
squad
and
the
head
coach
at
the
University
of
Miami
,
where
he
led
the
Hurricanes
to
five
winning
seasons
and
a
national
championship
in
1987
.
###
Whatever
Mr.
Johnson
's
talents
,
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
many
Dallas
fans
,
he
is
no
Tom
Landry
.
###
Seven
games
-LRB-
and
,
after
a
loss
to
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
yesterday
,
seven
losses
-RRB-
into
the
season
,
the
``
new
''
Cowboys
are
n't
doing
any
better
than
the
old
.
###
In
fact
,
the
last
time
they
played
this
badly
was
in
1960
,
their
opening
season
.
###
Average
attendance
at
their
games
,
about
49,000
last
year
,
continues
flat
.
###
Mr.
Jones
is
attacking
the
problem
on
several
fronts
.
###
He
continues
to
reshuffle
the
team
,
trading
famed
running
back
Herschel
Walker
to
the
Minnesota
Vikings
this
month
for
a
slew
of
players
and
future
draft
picks
.
###
To
try
to
draw
more
fans
,
he
has
dropped
end-zone
ticket
prices
from
$
25
to
$
19
.
###
But
the
general
trend
,
given
rising
costs
in
the
league
,
has
been
to
raise
prices
,
and
Mr.
Jones
is
expected
to
eventually
follow
suit
.
###
``
It
's
simple
,
''
says
Lamar
Hunt
,
who
owns
the
Kansas
City
Chiefs
and
last
year
raised
ticket
prices
by
$
2.40
to
an
average
$
17
.
###
If
we
did
n't
increase
prices
,
we
'd
be
in
the
red
.
''
###
Mr.
Jones
has
also
beefed
up
his
marketing
staff
to
sell
the
118
luxury
suites
topping
Texas
Stadium
-LRB-
his
deal
with
Bum
Bright
included
operating
rights
for
the
stadium
-RRB-
.
###
The
suites
are
air-conditioned
,
have
wet
bars
and
plush
seating
,
and
offer
a
clear
view
of
the
field
--
all
for
a
sale
price
of
$
475,000
to
$
1
million
,
depending
on
their
size
and
location
.
###
Mr.
Jones
has
been
taking
prospective
suite
owners
onto
the
field
during
practice
to
let
them
rub
elbows
with
players
,
and
promises
those
who
actually
buy
one
of
the
rooms
an
insider
's
look
at
the
team
's
strategy
before
game
time
.
###
The
sales
job
seems
to
be
paying
off
:
When
he
bought
the
team
,
only
six
of
the
suites
had
been
sold
.
###
Today
,
30
have
.
###
Gate
receipts
are
only
the
Cowboys
'
second
largest
source
of
cash
.
###
The
biggest
is
the
NFL
's
contract
with
national
television
for
broadcast
of
the
league
's
games
.
###
Last
year
,
the
Cowboys
'
share
of
that
pie
came
to
$
17.6
million
.
###
The
team
additionally
earns
between
$
2
million
and
$
4
million
for
local
radio
and
television
broadcast
rights
.
###
Mr.
Jones
is
currently
trying
to
jack
up
the
price
for
those
local
rights
.
###
He
is
also
trying
to
get
more
stations
in
Mexico
,
where
the
Cowboys
have
a
following
,
to
pick
up
the
games
.
###
Mr.
Jones
,
whose
twangy
voice
and
folksy
ways
belie
an
intense
businessman
who
works
16-hour
days
,
is
resigned
to
the
hefty
salaries
he
pays
his
players
these
days
.
###
He
calls
the
contracts
``
critical
to
winning
in
the
NFL
''
and
has
played
his
part
in
the
bidding
wars
.
###
Besides
signing
Mr.
Aikman
to
a
sizable
contract
,
Mr.
Jones
has
agreed
to
pay
rookie
quarterback
Steve
Walsh
$
4.1
million
over
the
next
four
years
.
###
This
wage
inflation
is
bleeding
the
NFL
dry
,
the
owners
contend
.
###
Soon
,
only
large
corporations
will
be
able
to
afford
to
buy
and
run
football
teams
,
predicts
John
J.
Veatch
Jr.
,
an
investment
banker
with
Salomon
Brothers
who
handled
the
Cowboys
sale
.
###
To
tackle
the
problem
,
NFL
owners
have
proposed
setting
a
rookie
wage
scale
to
try
to
rein
in
salaries
.
###
Details
of
the
plan
,
which
would
go
into
effect
in
1993
,
are
sketchy
,
but
each
player
would
apparently
be
paid
a
base
salary
keyed
to
his
position
and
ability
.
###
Bonuses
would
be
paid
based
on
playing
time
and
performance
.
###
The
NFL
Players
Association
,
meanwhile
,
contends
that
athletes
are
paid
a
wage
commensurate
with
their
ability
to
draw
fans
,
and
that
some
owners
are
in
financial
trouble
because
of
poor
business
management
,
not
players
'
salaries
.
###
The
owners
are
trying
to
boost
profit
in
other
ways
,
too
.
###
Many
have
launched
promotions
to
attract
new
fans
and
are
renegotiating
dated
stadium
contracts
.
###
Most
of
the
owners
must
pay
up
to
10
%
of
gross
ticket
sales
for
leases
on
stadiums
they
say
are
either
too
small
or
too
old
.
###
In
Chicago
,
for
example
,
size
is
the
issue
.
###
``
We
have
the
worst
lease
in
the
NFL
,
''
contends
Michael
B.
McCaskey
,
the
president
of
the
Chicago
Bears
and
a
grandson
of
George
Halas
,
who
founded
the
NFL
's
predecessor
organization
.
###
``
We
're
in
a
metro
area
with
millions
of
Bear
fans
,
and
only
a
small
number
can
be
accommodated
.
''
###
When
the
lease
expires
in
1999
,
he
says
,
``
It
's
got
to
be
changed
.
''
###
This
year
,
the
NFL
also
imposed
an
80-player
limit
on
teams
going
into
training
camp
,
down
from
120
,
in
a
move
meant
to
trim
payroll
costs
.
###
And
the
league
is
trying
to
get
more
for
its
three-year
national
network
contract
,
which
expires
after
this
season
.
###
The
current
contract
pays
the
NFL
$
1.4
billion
.
###
Owners
say
they
expect
the
league
to
demand
a
50
%
increase
,
despite
the
fact
that
televised
football
games
have
had
lackluster
ratings
.
###
An
NFL
spokesman
also
says
the
league
will
probably
expand
its
offerings
to
cable
TV
companies
like
ESPN
.
###
The
changes
have
n't
come
easy
.
###
Like
the
game
of
professional
football
,
the
NFL
organization
itself
is
in
turmoil
.
###
The
new
breed
of
team
owner
,
Mr.
Jones
included
,
has
been
fighting
the
NFL
bureaucracy
for
a
greater
say
in
league
affairs
,
and
the
battle
has
produced
a
form
of
organizational
gridlock
.
###
In
July
,
11
NFL
owners
,
almost
all
of
them
new
,
blocked
an
effort
to
install
Jim
Finks
as
a
replacement
for
retiring
league
commissioner
Pete
Rozelle
.
###
Mr.
Finks
is
perceived
by
some
owners
as
a
standard-bearer
for
the
Old
Guard
.
###
Earlier
this
month
,
another
effort
to
choose
a
commissioner
failed
.
###
The
owners
meet
again
tomorrow
.
###
For
his
part
,
Jerry
Jones
says
he
's
in
the
business
for
the
long
haul
,
and
his
work
style
seems
to
support
that
.
###
He
puts
in
busy
six-day
weeks
-LRB-
excluding
game
days
-RRB-
,
and
on
one
recent
afternoon
fielded
questions
,
in
the
course
of
an
hour
,
from
a
TV
producer
,
his
luxury-suite
marketing
manager
,
a
disgruntled
customer
and
a
roomful
of
Arkansas
reporters
.
###
To
keep
his
schedule
on
track
,
he
flies
two
personal
secretaries
in
from
Little
Rock
to
augment
his
staff
in
Dallas
.
###
``
When
I
made
this
investment
,
I
made
it
on
a
lifetime
basis
,
''
he
explains
.
###
``
I
'm
not
here
to
make
money
by
reselling
the
team
later
on
.
###
While
the
Cowboys
may
not
be
the
best
investment
now
,
I
do
n't
accept
they
ca
n't
be
in
the
future
.
''
###
Besides
,
to
a
large
extent
,
Mr.
Jones
may
already
be
getting
what
he
wants
out
of
the
team
,
even
though
it
keeps
losing
.
###
Owning
the
Cowboys
has
bought
him
entree
to
a
glitzy
life
that
drilling
for
oil
in
Arkansas
just
did
n't
provide
.
###
There
is
the
new
private
jet
,
the
platoon
of
assistants
,
invitations
to
the
best
parties
,
and
television
appearances
on
shows
such
as
``
Prime
Time
Live
.
''
###
A
few
weeks
ago
,
Mr.
Jones
even
entertained
Elizabeth
Taylor
in
his
private
suite
at
Texas
Stadium
.
###
``
You
're
in
the
catbird
seat
every
day
in
this
job
,
''
he
says
.
###
How
interestingly
clever
of
Robert
Goldberg
to
use
the
form
of
pretend
advocacy
journalism
to
explain
his
perception
of
``
Days
of
Rage
''
in
his
television
critique
-LRB-
Leisure
&
Arts
,
Sept
11
-RRB-
.
###
He
chastises
Jo
Franklin-Trout
for
her
inept
presentation
of
advocacy
journalism
,
judging
her
project
as
``
intellectually
slipshod
.
''
###
Was
not
the
title
very
clear
?
###
One
example
he
gives
:
``
She
did
n't
ask
''
-LRB-
why
the
Palestinian
children
are
soldiers
throwing
stones
-RRB-
.
###
Really
now
,
did
she
have
to
ask
?
###
Were
not
the
pictures
and
happenings
,
which
have
been
continuing
news
headlines
,
answers
enough
?
###
Mr.
Goldberg
contends
that
even
as
``
propaganda
''
the
film
fails
because
it
presents
only
one
view
.
###
Of
course
the
Palestinians
complain
about
their
treatment
;
of
course
the
Israelis
feel
put
upon
.
###
But
his
complaint
that
``
Days
of
Rage
''
does
n't
contain
balanced
comments
from
Israelis
about
how
badly
the
Palestinians
are
behaving
is
irrelevant
.
###
It
's
like
doing
a
documentary
on
apartheid
and
insisting
that
equal
time
be
given
to
how
terrific
white
South
Africans
are
.
###
This
film
did
emphasize
how
long
the
stalemate
has
existed
by
tracing
the
conflict
to
the
days
of
World
War
I
when
the
British
tried
to
guarantee
both
a
Jewish
state
and
a
Palestinian
state
without
specifying
how
it
was
to
be
done
.
###
Well
,
``
Days
of
Rage
''
airing
with
before-and-after
packaging
,
and
after
repeated
delays
,
was
a
beginning
.
###
Every
issue
is
multisided
.
###
This
film
attempts
to
show
a
side
rarely
seen
in
our
media
.
###
Now
we
must
endure
a
rash
of
critics
who
apparently
wish
to
know
details
of
one
side
only
.

President
Bush
wants
the
Pentagon
to
get
special
treatment
in
coping
with
the
across-the-board
spending
cuts
that
took
effect
last
week
.
###
Mr.
Bush
asked
Congress
to
raise
to
$
6
billion
from
$
3
billion
the
amount
of
money
Defense
Secretary
Dick
Cheney
may
shift
among
the
Pentagon
's
individual
programs
,
projects
and
activities
,
allowing
him
to
ease
the
pain
that
the
Gramm-Rudman
budget
law
was
intended
to
inflict
.
###
If
the
request
is
approved
by
both
the
House
and
Senate
,
Mr.
Cheney
would
need
only
permission
from
the
White
House
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
to
move
the
money
,
according
to
Senate
budget
analysts
.
###
That
would
give
the
Pentagon
flexibility
that
no
other
federal
agency
has
.
###
``
It
's
simply
a
way
of
making
the
cuts
less
onerous
for
defense
than
they
are
for
domestic
programs
,
''
said
Chairman
James
Sasser
-LRB-
D.
,
Tenn
.
-RRB-
of
the
Senate
Budget
Committee
,
who
said
he
would
oppose
the
request
.
###
``
That
is
n't
consistent
with
the
kind
of
discipline
that
Gramm-Rudman
is
supposed
to
impose
,
''
he
said
.
###
The
president
's
request
did
n't
indicate
how
Mr.
Cheney
would
shift
the
money
.
###
A
Pentagon
official
said
the
request
was
made
to
give
the
department
``
maximum
flexibility
''
to
deal
with
the
cuts
.
###
Last
week
,
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
structured
the
$
16.1
billion
spending
reduction
,
half
of
which
must
come
from
defense
,
to
``
impose
a
little
bit
more
discipline
''
by
applying
cuts
to
each
individual
program
,
project
or
activity
in
the
budget
.
###
That
would
give
agencies
``
less
ability...
to
fudge
over
things
,
''
he
told
reporters
.
###
Under
the
deficit-reduction
law
,
4.3
%
of
the
Pentagon
's
money
and
5.3
%
of
other
agencies
'
money
has
been
canceled
.
###
Lawmakers
are
expected
to
try
to
restore
the
funds
once
a
pending
deficit-cutting
measure
has
been
signed
into
law
.
###
Rochester

Corp.
said
it

Telephone
Corp.
,
of
Clintonville
,
Wis.
,
the
second-largest
unaffiliated
independent
telephone
company
in
that
state
.
###
Rochester
Telephone
said
the
acquisition
was
made
in
an
exchange
of
its
common
shares
for
all
the
shares
of
Urban
Telephone
,
but
a
price
was
n't
disclosed
.
###
Urban
is
the
company
's
first
telephone
subsidiary
in
Wisconsin
.
###
Since
June
,
Rochester
Telephone
signed
letters
of
intent
to
purchase
three
other
Wisconsin
firms
.
###
A
bill
that
would
permit
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
to
monitor
the
financial
condition
of
securities
firms
'
holding
companies
is
facing
tough
opposition
from
some
Wall
Street
firms
,
which
argue
that
the
legislation
is
unnecessary
.
###
The
legislation
and
other
issues
related
to
the
stock
market
will
be
the
focus
of
hearings
this
week
by
the
House
Telecommunications
and
Finance
Subcommittee
and
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
.
###
Richard
Breeden
,
the
new
chairman
of
the
SEC
,
has
n't
taken
a
formal
position
on
the
bill
,
which
would
also
require
investors
to
disclose
large
trades
and
give
the
SEC
additional
authority
during
market
emergencies
.
###
However
,
he
recently
told
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
that
he
believes
the
agency
should
have
explicit
authority
to
monitor
debt
levels
at
holding
companies
and
affiliates
of
broker-dealers
,
which
are
frequently
used
to
issue
bridge
loans
.
###
The
bridge
loans
are
intended
to
provide
temporary
financing
for
acquisitions
.
###
Since
such
loans
are
often
refinanced
through
the
sale
of
high-risk
,
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
the
recent
woes
of
the
junk-bond
market
have
renewed
concerns
among
regulators
about
the
risks
associated
with
Wall
Street
firms
issuing
bridge
loans
.
###
But
some
Wall
Street
executives
argue
that
such
fears
are
unwarranted
.
###
In
a
July
6
letter
to
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
,
First
Boston
Corp.
argued
that
the
fact
that
no
retail
brokerage
firm
failed
during
the
1987
market
crash
demonstrates
that
current
rules
are
adequate
.
###
First
Boston
,
whose
holding
company
,
CS
First
Boston
Group
,
is
one
of
the
larger
issuers
of
bridge
loans
on
Wall
Street
,
said
it
is
also
concerned
that
once
the
SEC
has
the
power
to
monitor
holding
companies
,
it
will
try
to
regulate
their
activities
.
###
``
The
proposal
,
while
well-intended
,
I
think
can
be
dangerously
misleading
because
the
likely
consequence
would
be
to
weaken
,
rather
than
strengthen
the
control
the
SEC
has
exercised
for
50
years
over
the
financial
adequacy
and
viability
of
broker-dealers
,
''
Michael
Raoul-Duval
,
managing
director
of
First
Boston
,
said
in
an
interview
.
###
The
bill
would
``
divert
scarce
resources
of
the
commission
away
from
broker-dealers
into
areas
which
simply
have
no
way
of
affecting
broker-dealers
,
''
Mr.
Raoul-Duval
said
.
###
Sources
in
the
industry
and
on
Capitol
Hill
say
a
compromise
that
would
placate
the
industry
while
addressing
the
SEC
's
concerns
may
be
possible
.
###
An
aide
to
the
Senate
Securities
Subcommittee
says
some
legislators
support
the
concept
of
risk
disclosure
,
but
adds
:
``
nobody
is
wedded
to
the
language
in
the
bill
.
''
###
Edward
O'Brien
,
president
of
the
Securities
Industry
Association
,
said
that
the
securities-industry
trade
group
opposes
the
bill
as
it
is
written
but
that
it
is
``
hopeful
a
compromise
can
be
reached
to
achieve
the
SEC
's
goals
.
''
###
Mr.
O'Brien
will
elaborate
on
the
SIA
's
position
in
testimony
before
the
House
Telecommunications
and
Finance
Subcommittee
this
week
,
a
spokesman
said
.
###
This
letter
was
inspired
by
David
Asman
's
Sept.
25
editorial-page
article
about
Fidel
Castro
,
``
Man
in
the
Middle
of
Drug
Trafficking
.
''
###
I
've
organized
a
series
of
exchanges
,
exhibitions
and
other
continuing
projects
between
Cuban
and
American
artists
.
###
In
any
matters
between
us
and
the
Cubans
there
can
be
no
simplicity
,
consequently
I
've
become
familiar
not
only
with
Cuban
art
and
artists
,
but
also
with
Cuban
bureaucrats
and
their
counterparts
in
our
own
government
.
###
Despite
levels
of
obstruction
,
incompetence
and
ensuing
frustration
of
mythic
proportion
,
these
projects
all
remain
,
in
my
mind
,
valuable
and
well
worth
the
effort
.
###
There
is
a
simple
reason
for
this
:
the
Cuban
people
.
###
Let
me
immediately
put
limits
to
whatever
nostalgic
notions
that
may
intimate
.
###
Those
``
people
''
to
whom
I
refer
are
not
some
heroic
,
indecipherable
quantity
;
they
are
artists
,
critics
,
taxi
drivers
,
grandmothers
,
even
some
employees
of
the
Ministry
of
Culture
,
all
of
whom
share
a
deep
belief
in
the
original
principles
of
the
Cuban
Revolution
,
spelled
out
in
terms
such
as
equality
among
all
members
of
the
society
,
reverence
for
education
and
creative
expression
,
universal
rights
to
health
and
livelihood
,
housing
,
etc
.
###
In
fact
,
the
generation
of
painters
growing
into
maturity
right
now
works
with
such
profoundly
held
humanist
assumptions
and
such
passionate
commitment
to
moral
and
ethical
principles
that
it
makes
Che
Guevara
's
famous
linkages
of
art
idealism
and
revolution
seem
modest
.
###
It
is
on
behalf
of
these
people
,
and
out
of
my
real
respect
for
them
,
that
I
am
responding
to
Mr.
Asman
's
opinions
of
their
country
.
###
The
Ochoa
trial
in
July
,
with
its
revelations
of
deeply
rooted
and
widespread
corruption
,
and
the
summary
trial
and
execution
,
was
extremely
disturbing
to
everyone
who
has
ever
considered
himself
a
friend
of
Cuba
.
###
However
,
unacceptable
though
those
occurrences
may
have
been
,
they
still
provide
no
excuse
for
wholesale
departures
from
truth
.
###
Mr.
Asman
should
make
distinctions
among
Fidel
,
the
army
and
the
Cuban
people
.
###
They
are
not
interchangeable
,
since
they
are
motivated
to
act
based
on
their
own
circumstances
.
###
It
is
naivete
to
equate
a
government
's
policies
with
the
will
of
the
people
-LRB-
as
we
well
know
-RRB-
,
and
it
is
even
worse
folly
to
merge
the
clearly
divergent
agendas
of
Fidel
and
the
military
and
the
state
bureaucracy
.
###
Mr.
Asman
is
also
annoyed
that
Mr.
Castro
has
resisted
collaboration
with
U.S.
officials
,
even
though
by
his
own
account
that
collaboration
has
been
devised
essentially
as
a
mechanism
for
acts
directly
hostile
to
the
Cuban
regime
,
such
as
facilitating
defections
.
###
I
think
it
's
a
little
disingenuous
to
be
surprised
that
Fidel
does
n't
invite
the
U.S.
State
Department
to
violate
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Cuban
government
over
its
own
territory
.
###
We
badly
need
to
follow
fact
rather
than
the
rhetoric
of
conventional
wisdom
.
###
Without
this
basic
level
of
attention
to
reality
,
our
policies
on
Cuba
will
continue
to
be
as
counterproductive
as
they
have
for
30
years
.
###
From
my
own
point
of
view
,
given
the
qualities
of
humanity
,
creativity
and
warm
spirit
in
which
the
Cuban
people
excel
,
we
deny
ourselves
access
to
things
we
hold
dear
,
and
which
seem
to
run
in
such
short
supply
these
days
.
###
There
is
no
rational
justification
for
such
behavior
.

ENGRAPH
INC.
recently
reported
third-quarter
earnings
,
which
were
mistakenly
shown
in
the
Quarterly
Earnings
Surprises
table
in
last
Tuesday
's
edition
to
be
lower
than
the
average
of
analysts
'
estimates
.
###
Zacks
Investment
Research
did
n't
adjust
one
analyst
's
estimate
for
a
stock
split
,
which
therefore
was
artificially
high
.
###
Engraph
's
third-quarter
net
income
of
15
cents
a
share
actually
was
7
%
higher
than
the
adjusted
average
of
estimates
.
###
Investors
bailed
out
of
New
York
City
bonds
in
droves
last
week
,
driving
prices
lower
and
boosting
yields
.
###
One
bond
trader
estimated
that
more
than
$
50
million
of
New
York
City
general
obligation
bonds
were
put
up
for
sale
Friday
alone
.
###
While
that
represents
a
small
percentage
of
the
city
's
public
debt
outstanding
,
Friday
's
selling
followed
a
weeklong
effort
to
unload
the
bonds
by
a
broad
spectrum
of
institutional
and
individual
investors
.
###
``
I
've
never
seen
so
many
-LCB-
New
York
City
-RCB-
G.O.
's
up
for
sale
,
''
said
another
trader
.
###
``
Every
broker
has
blocks
of
every
size
and
maturity
.
''
###
Municipal
bond
analysts
said
the
sell-off
was
triggered
by
concerns
about
the
city
's
financial
health
,
rumors
of
a
$
900
million
bond
offering
coming
soon
,
and
political
uncertainty
.
###
A
spokesman
for
the
city
would
n't
confirm
the
size
of
the
bond
issue
,
but
did
say
that
a
general
obligation
offering
is
in
the
works
and
should
be
priced
sometime
in
the
next
two
weeks
,
before
the
November
mayoral
election
.
###
General
obligation
bonds
are
backed
by
the
city
's
overall
revenues
and
credit
.
-RRB-
###
Although
many
investors
were
aware
that
a
bond
offering
was
being
scheduled
,
many
expected
a
much
smaller
amount
of
bonds
to
be
sold
.
###
The
fact
that
the
city
will
issue
such
a
large
amount
of
debt
was
interpreted
as
a
sign
that
New
York
's
budgetary
problems
are
more
serious
than
had
been
expected
.
###
New
York
,
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
issuers
of
tax-exempt
bonds
,
sold
$
750
million
of
municipal
bonds
just
a
few
weeks
ago
.
###
There
have
been
reports
for
months
that
the
city
's
economy
is
weakening
,
as
the
October
1987
stock
market
crash
continues
to
make
itself
felt
.
###
The
recent
sharp
stock
market
decline
exacerbated
those
concerns
.
###
Meanwhile
,
tax
revenues
are
falling
while
the
city
's
spending
needs
are
expanding
.
###
Rumors
persisted
last
week
that
New
York
's
credit
ratings
--
single-A
from
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
and
single-A-minus
from
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
--
are
at
risk
.
###
The
weakness
in
New
York
City
bonds
follows
a
warning
from
New
York
state
Comptroller
Edward
Regan
that
the
1987
crash
seriously
weakened
the
city
's
economy
.
###
In
a
study
,
the
comptroller
said
,
``
The
city
's
glory
days
are
over
.
''
###
Mr.
Regan
warned
mayoral
candidates
``
to
be
prepared
for
limited
options
and
constraints
on
service
increases
to
address
the
city
's
problems
in
the
next
few
years
,
due
to
the
now-evident
weakening
in
the
New
York
City
economy
.
''
###
New
York
City
's
revised
financial
plan
,
due
out
later
this
month
,
is
expected
to
include
measures
to
balance
the
city
's
$
27
billion
budget
.
###
At
present
,
analysts
project
a
budget
gap
on
the
order
of
$
500
million
to
$
600
million
for
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30
,
1990
,
although
the
city
's
own
budget
analysts
project
a
narrower
deficit
.
###
Mark
Page
,
New
York
's
deputy
director
of
finance
,
said
that
investors
'
concerns
about
the
city
's
financial
health
are
``
unwarranted
given
our
proven
ability
to
manage
ourselves
.
''
###
He
charges
the
city
's
critics
with
spreading
``
unfounded
emotional
rhetoric
.
''
###
There
are
also
questions
about
whether
a
new
and
inexperienced
mayor
can
manage
the
city
through
what
could
become
a
financial
crisis
.
###
The
leading
contender
for
the
mayoral
office
,
Democrat
David
Dinkins
,
has
been
criticized
recently
for
the
way
he
handled
his
personal
financial
affairs
.
###
And
the
controversy
has
led
to
uncertainty
about
the
outcome
of
the
election
.
###
Until
last
week
,
Mr.
Dinkins
was
considered
a
shoo-in
.
###
``
The
market
can
adjust
to
good
news

but
uncertainty
drives

###
Until
last
week
,
``
Everyone
felt
certain
they
knew
the
outcome

the
election

###
Now
,
there
have
been
a
number
of
questions
raised
.
''
###
Last
week
,
yields
on
long-term
New
York
City
general
obligation
bonds
jumped
half
a
percentage
point

###
New
York
City
's
6
%

due
2018

for
example
,
were
quoted
late
Friday
at
a
price
to
yield
7.80
%
,
compared
with
7.60
%
Thursday
.
###
As
the
yield
on
New
York
general
obligation
bonds
rose
,
the
Bond
Buyer
20-bond
general
obligation
index
,
the
mostly
widely
followed
gauge
of
the
tax-exempt
market
,
held
steady
at
7.19
%
in
the
week
ended
Oct.
19
.
###
Qintex
Australia
Ltd.
encountered
another
setback
Friday
when
its
Los
Angeles-based
affiliate
,
Qintex
Entertainment
Inc.
,
filed
for
protection
under
Chapter
11
of
the
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Code

Qintex
Entertainment
also
said
David
Evans
,
its
president
and
chief
executive
,
and
Roger
Kimmel
,
a
director
,
both
resigned
.
###
Neither
could
be
reached
for
comment
.
###
Earlier
this
month
,
Qintex
Australia
's
$
1.5
billion
agreement
to
acquire
Communications
Co.
collapsed
because
of
a
dispute
over
a
$
50
million
letter
of
credit
the
Australian
operator
of
television
stations
and
resorts
was
to
have
supplied
as
security
in
the
transaction
.
###
Mr.
Evans
had
been
the
de
facto
head
of
for
months
.
###
Qintex
Entertainment
,
a
producer
and
distributor
of
television
programs
most
noted
for
its
co-production
of
the
hit
miniseries
``
Lonesome
Dove
,
''
said
it
filed
for
Chapter
11
protection
after
Qintex
Australia
failed
to
provide
it
with
$
5.9
million
owed
to
MCA
Inc.
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
``
The
New
Leave
It
to
Beaver
Show
.
''
###
Qintex
Entertainment
is
43
%
owned
by
Qintex
Australia
and
said
it
relies
on
the
Australian
company
for
funding
its
working
capital
requirements
.
###
After
the
announcement
of
the
bankruptcy
filing
,
Qintex
Entertainment
stock
sank
$
2.625
in
over-the-counter
trading
to
close
at
$
1.50
on
heavy
volume
of
more
than
1.4
million
shares
.
###
The
stock
traded
as
high
as
$
10
this
past
summer
.
###
Jonathan
Lloyd
,
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
of
Qintex
Entertainment
,
said
Qintex
Entertainment
was
forced
to
file
for
protection
to
avoid
going
into
default
under
its
agreement
with
MCA
.
###
The
$
5.9
million
payment
was
due
Oct.
1
and
the
deadline
for
default
was
Oct.
19
.
###
Mr.
Lloyd
said
if
Qintex
had
defaulted
it
could
have
been
required
to
repay
$
92
million
in
debt
under
its
loan
agreements
.
###
MCA
on
Friday
said
that
as
a
result
of
Qintex
's
failure
to
make
the
required
payment
it
was
terminating
the
distribution
agreement
on
``
The
New
Leave
It
to
Beaver
''
as
well
as
other
MCA
properties
.
###
Qintex
Australia
was
``
saying
as
recently
as
last
weekend
that
they
would
take

They
continued
to
represent
that
to
the
board

said
Mr.
Lloyd
.
###
``
We
were
reassured
they
would
stand
behind
the
company
.
''
###
Mr.
Lloyd
said
both
Qintex
Entertainment
and
Qintex
Australia
had
attempted
to
secure
a
loan
that
would
allow
the
company
to
make
the
$
5.9
million
payment
but
the
request
was
turned
down
by
an
unidentified

###
At
that
point
,
he
said
,
Qintex
Australia
stated
it
would
``
endeavor
to
arrange
''
the
financing
.
###
However
a
Qintex
Australia
spokesman
said
his
firm
had
never
``
promised
or
guaranteed
''
to
make
the
payment
.
###
In
a
prepared
statement
from
Australia
,
the
company
also
said
that
,
following
the
breakdown
of
the
MGM
talks
,
it
``
had
been
re-evaluating
its
position
as
a
significant
shareholder
and
a
substantial
creditor
of
Qintex
Entertainment
''
and
had
``
resolved
to
minimize
the
degree
of
further
loans
to
Qintex
Entertainment
in
excess
of
that
previously
made
.
''
###
The
Qintex
Australia
spokesman
added
that
his
company
had
opposed
the
Chapter
11
filing
.
###
He
said
the
company
believed
Qintex
Entertainment
's
financial
problems
could
have
been
resolved
by
other
means
.
###
The
report
of
the
bankruptcy
filing
stunned
Hollywood
executives
and
investors
.
###
``
It
's
a
shocker
,
''
said
Joseph
Di
Lillo
,
chairman
of
Drake
Capital
Securities
,
a
brokerage
firm
that
has
an
investment
in
Qintex
Entertainment
.
###
Qintex
Australia
was
``
going
to
pay
more
than
$
1
billion
for
and
then
they
could
n't
come
up
with
the
far
smaller
sum
of
$
5.9
million
.
''
###
Qintex
said
Mr.
Evans
,
the
former
president
,
resigned
for
``
personal
reasons
''
and
that
Mr.
Kimmel
,
an
attorney
,
resigned
because
his
participation
in
evaluating
the
company
's
role
in
buying
was
no
longer
necessary
.
###
Mr.
Kimmel
was
a
director
of
the
company
and
a
predecessor
firm
since
1980
.
###
The
announcement
seemed
to
further
damp
prospects
that
talks
between
Qintex
Australia
and
might
be
revived
.

It

which
made
two
failed

was
still
interested
.
###
However
,
``
we
are
n't
currently
doing
anything
.
###
It
is
n't
a
current

###
Japan
's
Finance
Ministry
strongly
denied
playing
any
role
in
the
New
York
stock-price
free
fall
.
###
Makoto
Utsumi
,
vice
minister
for
international
affairs
,
said
the
ministry
did
n't
in
any
way
suggest
to
Japanese
banks
that
they
stay
out
of
the
UAL
Corp.
leveraged
buy-out
.
###
The
ministry
has
never
even
suggested
that
Japanese
banks
be
cautious
about
leveraged
buy-outs
in
general
,
Mr.
Utsumi
said
.
###
``
There
are
no
facts
-LCB-
behind
the
assertions
-RCB-
that
we
sent
any
kind
of
signal
,
''
he
declared
in
an
interview
.
###
The
comments
were
the
ministry
's
first
detailed
public
statement
on
the
subject
,
and
reflect
the
ministry
's
concern
that
foreigners
will
think
Japan
is
using
its
tremendous
financial
power
to
control
events
in
foreign
markets
.
###
A
number
of
accounts
of
the
events
leading
to
the
190
point
drop
in
New
York
stock
prices
on
Oct.
13
accused
the
ministry
of
pulling
the
plug
on
the
UAL
deal
for
one
reason
or
another
.
###
Mr.
Utsumi
said
the
most
the
ministry
had
ever
done
was
ask
Japanese
banks
about
``
the
status
of
their
participation
''
in
one
previous
U.S.
leveraged
buy-out
.
###
The
ministry
inquired
about
that
deal
--
which
Mr.
Utsumi
declined
to
identify
--
because
the
large
presence
of
Japanese
banks
in
the
deal
was
``
being
strongly
criticized
in
the
U.S.
Congress
''
and
it
was
``
necessary
for
us
to
grasp
the
situation
.
''
###
He
said
the
inquiry
was
n't
made
in
a
way
that
the
banks
could
have
interpreted
as
either
encouraging
or
discouraging
participation
,
and
he
added
that
none
of
the
Japanese
banks
changed
their
posture
on
the
deal
as
a
result
of
the
inquiry
.
###
Mr.
Utsumi
also
said
some
Japanese
banks
were
willing
to
participate
in
the
UAL
financing
up
to
the
very
end
,
which
would
suggest
at
the
very
least
that
they
were
n't
under
orders
to
back
out
.
###
In
general
,
Mr.
Utsumi
said
,
Japanese
banks
are
becoming
more
``
independent
''
in
their
approach
to
overseas
deals
.
###
``
Each
Japanese
bank
has
its
own
judgment
on
the
profits
and
risks
in
that
-LCB-
UAL
-RCB-
deal
,
''
he
said
.
###
``
They
are
becoming
more
independent
.
###
It
's
a
sound
phenomenon
.
''
###
Sanwa
Bank
Ltd.
is
one
Japanese
bank
that
decided
not
to
participate
in
the
first
UAL
proposal
.
###
A
Sanwa
Bank
spokesman
denied
that
the
finance
ministry
played
any
part
in
the
bank
's
decision
.
###
``
We
made
our
own
decision
,
''
he
said
.
###
Still
,
Mr.
Utsumi
may
have
a
hard
time
convincing
market
analysts
who
have
rightly
or
wrongly
believed
that
the
ministry
played
a
role
in
orchestrating
recent
moves
by
Japanese
banks
.
###
All
week
there
has
been
much
speculation
in
financial
circles
in
Tokyo
and
abroad
about
the
ministry
's
real
position
.
###
Bank
analysts
say
ministry
officials
have
been
growing
increasingly
concerned
during
the
past
few
months
about
Japanese
banks
getting
in
over
their
heads
.
###
``
The
-LCB-
ministry
-RCB-
thinks
the
banks
do
n't
know
what
they
are
doing
,
that
they
have
very
little
idea
how
to
cope
with
risk
,
''
said
one
foreign
bank
analyst
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
.
###
``
The
-LCB-
ministry
-RCB-
wants
to
see
the
Japanese
banks
pull
in
their
horns
''
on
leveraged
buy-outs
,
he
added
.
###
Although
some
of
the
Japanese
banks
involved
in
the
first
proposed
bid
for
UAL
bowed
out
because
they
found
the
terms
unattractive
,
observers
here
say
they
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
commercial
considerations
were
the
only
reason
.
###
Japanese
banks
are
under
``
political
pressure
''
as
well
,
the
analyst
said
.
###
Moreover
,
analysts
point
out
that
Japanese
banks
have
a
reputation
for
doing
deals
that
are
n't
extremely
profitable
if
they
offer
the
chance
to
build
market
share
,
cement
an
important
business
relationship
or
curry
favor
with
powerful
bureaucrats
.
###
Clearly
,
some
financial
authorities
are
concerned
about
the
Japanese
banks
role
in
leveraged
buy-outs
.
###
At
a
news
conference
this
week
,
Bank
of
Japan
Gov.
Satoshi
Sumita
cautioned
banks
to
take
a
``
prudent
''
stance
regarding
highly
leveraged
deals
.
###
Despite
Mr.
Sumita
's
statements
,
it
is
the
Finance
Ministry
,
not
the
central
bank
,
that
makes
policy
decisions
.
###
While
recent
events
may
cool
some
of
the
leveraged
buy-out
fever
,
Japanese
banks
are
n't
likely
to
walk
away
from
the
game
.
###
Despite
the
risks
,
the
deals
can
be
an
attractive
way
for
Japanese
banks
to
increase
their
presence
in
the
U.S.
market
,
bank
analysts
say
.
###
Flush
with
cash
at
home
,
but
with
fewer
customers
to
lend
to
,
leading
banks
are
eager
to
expand
overseas
.
###
Jumping
in
on
big
deals
is
a
high
profile
way
to
leapfrog
the
problem
of
not
having
a
strong
retail-banking
network
.
###
France
's
national
tobacco
company
,
known
for
making
brown-tobacco
cigarettes
such
as
Gauloises
and
Gitanes
,
is
branching
out
.
###
Concerned
by
dipping
demand
for
its
traditional
products
,
it
is
moving
not
only
into
blonde
cigarettes
,
but
also
into
electronic
car-parking
payment
cards
to
be
sold
in
neighborhood
tobacco
stores
.
###
Brown
tobacco
in
France
is
a
more
pungent
,
stronger
grade
than
the
lighter
grade
,
or
blonde
tobacco
,
used
in
so-called
American-style
cigarettes
.
###
``
We
are
n't
Philip
Morris
Cos.
,
''
says
Bertrand
de
Galle
,
chairman
of
government-owned
Societe
Nationale
d'Exploitation
Industrielle
des
Tabacs
&
Allumettes
S.A.
,
known
as
Seita
.
###
He
says
that
because
Seita
's
profits
are
limited
by
government-controlled
cigarette
prices
,
he
does
n't
have
the
cash
to
diversify
as
heavily
into
food
and
drink
as
the
U.S.
concern
has
done
.
###
-LRB-
Last
year
,
for
example
,
Seita
's
net
profit
soared
150
%
to
461.6
million
French
francs
-LRB-
$
73.5
million
-RRB-
on
sales
of
FFr27.68
billion-a
1.7
%
profit
margin
.
-RRB-
###
Instead
,
he
said
in
an
interview
,
he
is
looking
for
ways
to
exploit
France
's
network
of
39,000
tobacco
agents
,
most
of
them
cafes
.
###
While
Seita
does
n't
own
the
French
tabacs
,
its
close
alliance
with
them
offers
distribution
possibilities
.
###
One
proposal
is
to
introduce
a
new
payment
system
for
parking
in
Paris
.
###
Instead
of
paying
for
parking
by
putting
money
in
the
existing
machines
,
which
deliver
little
paper
receipts
,
drivers
would
be
able
to
buy
electronic
cards
in
local
tobacco
shops
.
###
Once
activated
,
the
card
would
sit
in
the
car
's
window
,
showing
traffic
wardens
how
much
time
the
motorist
could
remain
.
###
When
the
motorist
returned
to
his
car
he
could
turn
the
card
off
and
,
if
it
showed
time
remaining
,
save
it
for
later
.
###
Seita
is
a
partner
in
the
project
,
which
was
developed
by
Matra
SA
using
Japanese
technology
.
###
Seita
and
Matra
currently
are
negotiating
with
city
officials
for
the
right
to
begin
service
.
###
And
Seita
is
considering
further
diversification
.
###
It
wanted
to
buy
RJR
Nabisco
Inc.
's
French
cracker
subsidiary
,
Belin
,
in
hopes
of
selling
its
products
in
tobacco
stores
,
but
lost
the
bidding
to
food
group
BSN
SA
.
###
It
currently
is
considering
bidding
for
Swedish
Match
Co
.
###
And
it
retains
an
interest
in
acquiring
candies
and
other
articles
that
might
be
sold
in
tobacco
shops
.
###
It
also
is
trying
to
shore
up
its
tobacco
business
.
###
Brown-tobacco
cigarettes
such
as
Gauloises
now
make
up
just
40
%
of
the
French
tobacco
market
,
half
the
level
of
about
two
decades
ago
.
###
While
Seita
retains
a
manufacturing
monopoly
in
France
,
it
is
being
hurt
by
rising
imports
and
from
waning
cigarette
demand
.
###
So
Seita
has
introduced
blonde
cigarettes
under
the
Gauloises
label
,
and
intends
to
relaunch
the
unsuccessful
Gitanes
Blondes
in
new
packaging
,
similar
to
the
slide-packs
used
by
brown-tobacco
Gitanes
.
###
The
aim
,
says
Mr.
de
Galle
,
is
to
win
market
share
from
imported
cigarettes
,
and
to
persuade
smokers
who
are
switching
to
blonde
cigarettes
to
keep
buying
French
.
###
When
the
Supreme
Court
upheld
Missouri
's
abortion
restrictions
last
July
,
the
justices
almost
certainly
did
n't
have
drunk
driving
,
trespassing
and
false
imprisonment
on
their
minds
.
###
But
the
5-4
ruling
may
have
had
as
much
immediate
impact
on
those
activities
--
especially
trespassing
--
as
on
abortion
rights
.
###
The
decision
,
Webster
vs.
Reproductive
Health
Services
,
illustrates
how
Supreme
Court
rulings
often
have
a
ripple
effect
,
spreading
into
areas
of
law
and
policy
that
were
n't
part
of
the
actual
cases
decided
and
that
never
were
contemplated
by
the
justices
.
###
In
the
Missouri
case
,
unforeseen
consequences
may
have
arisen
because
the
high
court
reinstated
the
preamble
of
the
state
's
1986
abortion
law
.
###
The
preamble
says
that
human
life
begins
at
conception
and
that
unborn
children
have
rights
protected
by
the
Constitution
.
###
Last
year
,
a
federal
appeals
court
in
St.
Louis
said
the
preamble
was
unconstitutional
,
citing
an
earlier
Supreme
Court
ruling
that
states
ca
n't
justify
stricter
abortion
curbs
by
changing
the
definition
of
when
life
begins
.
###
But
the
Supreme
Court
concluded
that
it
was
premature
to
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
preamble
because
the
definition
of
human
life
had
n't
yet
been
used
to
restrict
abortion
services
.
###
The
high
court
majority
said
it
was
up
to
the
state
courts
for
now
to
decide
whether
the
definition
has
any
bearing
on
other
state
laws
.
###
Already
,
local
Missouri
judges
have
relied
on
the
restored
preamble
in
two
separate
cases
to
throw
out
criminal
trespass
charges
against
anti-abortion
demonstrators
who
blocked
access
to
Reproductive
Health
Services
,
an
abortion
clinic
in
St.
Louis
.
###
The
protesters
said
their
actions
were
justified
by
the
desire
to
save
the
lives
of
unborn
children
.
###
Under
a
1981
Missouri
law
,
persons
accused
of
some
crimes
,
including
trespassing
,
may
offer
a
defense
that
their
actions
were
justified
``
as
an
emergency
measure
to
avoid
an
imminent
public
or
private
injury
.
''
###
Relying
on
the
preamble
's
statement
that
a
fetus
is
an
unborn
child
,
the
two
St.
Louis
County
Circuit
Court
judges
in
August
accepted
the
justification
that
the
abortion
clinic
protesters
were
trying
to
save
lives
.
###
In
another
case
,
a
protester
,
Ann
O'Brien
,
was
convicted
of
trespass
before
the
Supreme
Court
's
Webster
ruling
.
###
Last
week
,
when
her
appeal
was
argued
before
the
Missouri
Court
of
Appeals
,
her
lawyer
also
relied
on
the
preamble
.
###
``
The
effect
of
the
Supreme
Court
Webster
opinion
is
that
it
left
room
for
grass
to
grow
in
the
cracks
of
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
and
I
think
this
is
one
of
the
cracks
,
''
said
Mark
Belz
,
a
St.
Louis
lawyer
who
represented
Ms.
O'Brien
and
the
other
St.
Louis
protesters
.
###
Roe
vs.
Wade
was
the
Supreme
Court
's
1973
decision
that
recognized
a
woman
's
right
to
abortion
.
###
Mario
Mandina
,
president
of
Kansas
City
Lawyers
for
Life
,
says
that
if
abortion
foes
succeed
in
using
the
preamble
to
escape
prosecution
for
trespass
,
``
This
will
shut
down
abortion
in
Missouri
.
###
There
's
no
risk
to
the
protesters
,
and
you
ca
n't
keep
an
abortion
clinic
open
if
there
are
3,000
people
standing
outside
every
day
.
''
###
That
would
be
an
ironic
result
of
a
case
in
which
the
Supreme
Court
expressly
stopped
short
of
overruling
Roe
vs.
Wade
.
###
In
two
other
cases
,
the
possible
consequences
of
the
Supreme
Court
ruling
appear
even
more
unintended
.
###
In
one
,
the
lawyer
for
a
20-year-old
resident
of
Columbia
,
Mo.
,
who
was
charged
with
drunk
driving
,
argued
that
his
client
should
be
treated
as
a
21-year-old
adult
because
his
actual
age
should
be
calculated
from
conception
,
not
from
birth
.
###
In
Missouri
,
those
caught
drinking
and
driving
between
the
ages
of
16
and
21
may
have
their
licenses
revoked
for
one
year
,
while
those
21
or
older
suffer
only
a
30-day
suspension
.
###
A
Boone
County
judge
rejected
the
motion
,
but
Daniel
Dodson
,
a
Jefferson
City
lawyer
,
says
he
has
appealed
.
###
And
in
a
case
filed
in
federal
court
in
August
,
a
lawyer
is
arguing
that
Missouri
authorities
are
wrongfully
imprisoning
the
fetus
of
a
pregnant
woman
who
is
in
jail
for
theft
and
forgery
.
###
In
terms
of
sheer
brutality
,
the
Somali
regime
of
Siad
Barre
may
rank
as
No.
1
in
the
world
.
###
The
only
reason
that
Somalia
remains
in
obscurity
is
numbers
:
a
sparsely
populated
wasteland
of
8.5
million
people
spread
out
over
an
expanse
nearly
the
size
of
Texas
.
###
The
Barre
dictatorship
simply
is
limited
in
the
amount
of
people
it
can
torture
and
kill
.
###
Beheading
small
children
,
stabbing
elderly
people
to
death
,
raping
and
shooting
women
,
and
burying
people
alive
are
just
a
few
of
the
grisly
activities
that
the
Somali
armed
forces
have
been
engaged
in
over
the
past
two
years
.
###
Up
to
500,000
Somalis
have
escaped
to
the
relative
safety
of
Marxist
Ethiopia
because
of
the
behavior
of
President
Barre
's
troops
.
###
In
the
port
of
Berbera
,
for
example
,
hundreds
of
men
of
the
rival
Issak
clan
were
rounded
up
in
May
1988
,
imprisoned
,
and
then
taken
out
at
night
in
groups
of
five
to
50
men
to
be
executed
without
any
judicial
process
whatsoever
.
###
Guns
were
never
used
:
Each
man
was
stabbed
to
death
with
a
large
knife
.
###
The
horrific
details
are
only
now
emerging
from
a
painstakingly
documented
report
,
based
on
hundreds
of
interviews
with
randomly
selected
refugees
.
###
The
study
was
done
by
Robert
Gersony
,
a
consultant
to
the
U.S.
State
Department
who
has
years
of
experience
in
investigating
human-rights
abuses
on
both
sides
of
the
left-right
ideological
divide
.
###
What
gives
these
events
particular
significance
,
however
,
is
the
fact
that
they
are
part
of
a
wider
drama
affecting
the
strategic
positions
of
both
the
U.S.
and
the
Soviet
Union
on
the
horn
of
Africa
.
###
Not
since
the
late
1970s
has
the
horn
been
so
up
for
grabs
as
it
has
suddenly
become
in
just
the
past
few
weeks
.
###
Mr.
Barre
's
rule
is
crumbling
fast
.
###
Mutinies
wrack
his
armed
forces
-LRB-
really
just
an
armed
gang
-RRB-
,
which
control
less
than
half
the
country
.
###
Inflation
is
at
record
levels
.
###
Desperate
,
he
has
called
in
the
Libyans
to
help
fight
the
rebels
of
the
Somali
National
Movement
in
the
north
,
which
is
only
one
of
several
groups
picking
away
at
the
regime
in
the
capital
of
Mogadishu
.
###
Seventy
years
old
and
a
self-declared
``
scientific
socialist
,
''
President
Barre
has
a
power
base
,
composed
only
of
his
minority
Mareham
clan
,
that
according
to
observers
is
``
narrowing
.
''
###
The
U.S.
's
interest
in
Somalia
consists
of
a
single
runway
at
the
port
of
Berbera
,
which
U.S.
military
aircraft
have
the
right
to
use
for
surveillance
of
the
Gulf
of
Aden
and
the
Indian
Ocean
.
###
That
strip
of
concrete
is
backed
up
by
a
few
one-story
,
air-conditioned
shacks
where
a
handful
of
American
nationals
--
buttressed
by
imported
food
,
cold
soft
drinks
and
back
issues
of
Sports
Illustrated
--
maintain
radio
contact
with
the
outside
world
.
###
In
the
past
two
years
,
the
desert
behind
them
has
become
a
land
of
mass
executions
and
utter
anarchy
,
where
,
due
to
Mr.
Barre
's
brutality
and
ineptitude
,
nobody
is
any
longer
in
control
.
###
As
long
as
the
rival
Soviet-backed
regime
of
Mengistu
Haile
Mariam
held
a
total
gridlock
over
neighboring
Ethiopia
,
the
U.S.
was
forced
to
accept
that
lonely
Berbera
runway
as
a
distant
No.
2
to
the
Soviets
'
array
of
airfields
next
door
.
###
But
due
to
dramatic
events
on
the
battlefield
over
the
past
few
days
and
weeks
,
those
Soviet
bases
may
soon
be
as
endangered
and
as
lonely
as
the
American
runway
.
###
On
Sept.
7
,
I
wrote
on
these
pages
about
the
killing
and
capturing
of
10,000
Ethiopian
soldiers
by
Eritrean
and
Tigrean
guerrillas
.
###
Recently
,
in
Wollo
province
in
the
center
of
Ethiopia
,
Tigrean
forces
have
killed
,
wounded
and
captured
an
additional
20,000
government
troops
.
###
-LRB-
Think
what
these
numbers
mean
--
considering
the
headline
space
devoted
to
hundreds
of
deaths
in
Lebanon
,
a
small
country
of
little
strategic
importance
-RRB-
###
Tigrean
armies
are
now
200
miles
north
of
Addis
Ababa
,
threatening
the
town
of
Dese
,
which
would
cut
off
Mr.
Mengistu
's
capital
from
the
port
of
Assab
,
through
which
all
fuel
and
other
supplies
reach
Addis
Ababa
.
###
As
a
result
,
Mr.
Mengistu
has
been
forced
to
transfer
thousands
of
troops
from
Eritrea
just
to
hold
the
town
,
thereby
risking
the
loss
of
even
more
territory
in
Eritrea
only
to
keep
the
Tigreans
at
bay
.
###
Mr.
Mengistu
is
in
an
increasingly
weak
position
:
Half
his
army
is
tied
down
defending
the
northern
city
of
Asmara
from
the
Eritreans
.
###
The
weaker
he
gets
,
the
more
he
turns
toward
the
U.S.
for
help
.
###
While
the
Tigreans
are
communists
,
like
the
Eritreans
they
are
among
the
most
anti-Soviet
guerrillas
in
the
world
,
having
suffered
more
than
a
decade
of
aerial
bombardment
by
the
Soviet-supplied
Mengistu
air
force
.
###
What
this
all
means
in
shorthand
is
that
Soviet
dominance
in
Ethiopia
is
collapsing
as
fast
as
President
Barre
's
regime
in
Somalia
is
.
###
The
U.S.
,
therefore
,
has
a
historic
opportunity
both
to
strike
a
blow
for
human
rights
in
Somalia
and
to
undo
the
superpower
flip-flop
of
the
late
1970s
on
the
Horn
of
Africa
.
###
Back
to
Somalia
:
The
State
Department
,
to
its
credit
,
has
already
begun
distancing
itself
from
Mr.
Barre
,
evinced
by
its
decision
to
publish
the
Gersony
report
-LRB-
which
the
press
has
ignored
-RRB-
###
What
's
more
,
the
U.S.
has
suspended
$
2.5
million
in
military
aid
and
$
1
million
in
economic
aid
.
###
But
this
is
not
enough
.
###
Because
the
U.S.
is
still
perceived
to
be
tied
to
Mr.
Barre
,
when
he
goes
the
runway
could
go
too
.
###
Considering
how
tenuous
the
security
of
that
runway
is
anyway
,
the
better
option
--
both
morally
and
strategically
--
would
be
for
the
Bush
administration
to
blast
the
regime
publicly
,
in
terms
clear
enough
for
all
influential
Somalis
to
understand
.
###
It
is
a
certainty
that
Mr.
Barre
's
days
are
numbered
.
###
The
U.S.
should
take
care
,
however
,
that
its
own
position
in
the
country
does
not
go
down
with
him
.
###
Nobody
is
sure
what
will
come
next
in
Somalia
or
whom
the
successor
might
be
.
###
But
as
one
expert
tells
me
:
``
Whoever
it
is
will
have
to
work
pretty
damn
hard
to
be
worse
than
Barre
.
''
###
While
the
State
Department
positions
itself
for
the
post-Barre
period
in
Somalia
,
it
should
continue
to
back
former
President
Carter
's
well-intentioned
role
as
a
mediator
between
Mr.
Mengistu
and
the
Eritrean
guerrillas
in
Ethiopia
,
while
concomitantly
opening
up
channels
of
communications
with
the
Tigrean
rebels
through
neighboring
Sudan
.
###
Ethiopian
politics
are
the
most
sophisticated
,
secretive
and
Byzantine
in
all
of
black
Africa
.
###
Remember
that
it
took
Mr.
Mengistu
many
months
,
in
what
became
known
as
the
``
creeping
coup
,
''
to
topple
Emperor
Haile
Selassie
in
1974
and
1975
.
###
There
is
simply
no
way
to
engineer
a
succession
covertly
,
as
is
sometimes
possible
elsewhere
on
the
continent
.
###
But
the
U.S.
has
one
great
advantage
:
The
Soviets
are
universally
loathed
throughout
Ethiopia
for
what
they
did
to
the
country
this
past
decade
--
famine
and
all
.
###
It
's
not
just
in
Eastern
Europe
where
the
march
of
events
is
finally
on
the
U.S.
side
,
but
on
the
horn
of
Africa
as
well
.
###
The
only
U.S.
liability
in
the
region
is
what
remains
of
the
link
to
Mr.
Barre
,
and
that
should
be
cut
fast
.

###
OPEC
's
ability
to
produce
more
petroleum
than
it
can
sell
is
beginning
to
cast
a
shadow
over
world
oil
markets
.
###
Output
from
the
Organization
of
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
is
already
at
a
high
for
the
year
and
most
member
nations
are
running
flat
out
.
###
But
industry
and
OPEC
officials
agree
that
a
handful
of
members
still
have
enough
unused
capacity
to
glut
the
market
and
cause
an
oil-price
collapse
a
few
months
from
now
if
OPEC
does
n't
soon
adopt
a
new
quota
system
to
corral
its
chronic
cheaters
.
###
As
a
result
,
the
effort
by
some
oil
ministers
to
get
OPEC
to
approve
a
new
permanent
production-sharing
agreement
next
month
is
taking
on
increasing
urgency
.
###
The
organization
is
scheduled
to
meet
in
Vienna
beginning
Nov.
25
.
###
So
far
this
year
,
rising
demand
for
OPEC
oil
and
production
restraint
by
some
members
have
kept
prices
firm
despite
rampant
cheating
by
others
.
###
But
that
could
change
if
demand
for
OPEC
's
oil
softens
seasonally
early
next
year
as
some
think
may
happen
.
###
OPEC
is
currently
producing
more
than
22
million
barrels
a
day
,
sharply
above
its
nominal
,
self-imposed
fourth-quarter
ceiling
of
20.5
million
,
according
to
OPEC
and
industry
officials
at
an
oil
conference
here
sponsored
by
the
Oil
Daily
and
the
International
Herald
Tribune
.
###
At
that
rate
,
a
majority
of
OPEC
's
13
members
have
reached
their
output
limits
,
they
said
.
###
But
it
is
estimated
that
at
least
three
million
barrels
a
day
--
and
possibly
as
much
as
seven
million
barrels
a
day
--
of
spare
capacity
still
exists
within
OPEC
.
###
Most
is
concentrated
in
five
Persian
Gulf
countries
,
including
his
own
,
Issam
Al-Chalabi
,
Iraq
's
oil
minister
,
told
the
conference
Friday
.
###
He
puts
OPEC
's
current
capacity
at
28
million
to
29
million
barrels
a
day
.
###
That
's
higher
than
some
other
estimates
.
###
Ali
Khalifa
Al-Sabah
,
Kuwait
's
oil
minister
,
recently
estimated
OPEC
capacity
at
25
million
barrels
a
day
.
###
Either
way
,
the
overhang
is
big
enough
to
keep
delicately
balanced
oil
markets
on
edge
.
###
Even
modest
amounts
of
additional
output
by
those
with
the
huge
extra
capacity
and
reserves
,
such
as
Saudi
Arabia
and
Iraq
,
could
upset
the
market
.
###
The
Iraqi
oil
minister
and
Saudi
oil
minister
Hisham
Nazer
insisted
in
their
comments
to
the
conference
that
their
countries
would
act
responsibly
to
maintain
a
stable
market
.
###
However
,
in
interviews
later
,
both
ministers
stressed
that
they
expect
future
OPEC
quotas
to
be
based
mainly
on
the
production
capacity
and
reserves
of
each
member
.
###
Under
that
approach
,
countries
with
the
most
unused
oil
capacity
would
get
bigger
shares
of
any
future
increases
in
OPEC
's
production
ceiling
than
they
would
under
the
current
system
.
###
``
If
you
are
already
producing
at
95
%
or
100
%
of
your
capacity
,
what
's
the
good
to
be
told
you
can
produce
at
105
%
of
capacity
?
''
asked
Mr.
Al-Chalabi
.
###
At
an
inconclusive
Geneva
meeting
late
last
month
,
OPEC
's
oil
ministers
halfheartedly
approved
another
increase
of
one
million
barrels
a
day
in
their
production
ceiling
.
###
They
doled
it
out
using
the
existing
formula
,
however
,
which
meant
that
even
those
countries
that
could
n't
produce
more
received
higher
official
allotments
.
###
The
main
effect
of
the
ceiling
boost
was
to
``
legitimize
''
some
of
the
overproduction
already
coming
from
the
quota
cheaters
.
###
Still
,
there
was
a
breakthrough
at
Geneva
.
###
Previously
,
no
OPEC
member
had
been
willing
to
accept
a
reduction
in
its
percentage
share
of
the
group
's
total
output
target
,
or
ceiling
.
###
But
the
concept
of
disproportionate
quotas
for
those
with
unused
capacity
,
advanced
there
in
an
Iranian
proposal
,
was
generally
endorsed
by
the
ministers
.
###
In
the
end
politics
got
in
the
way
.
###
Libya
accepted
Iran
's
proposal
only
so
long
as
it
was
promised
production
parity
with
Kuwait
.
###
And
the
United
Arab
Emirates
,
a
chronic
quota
cheater
,
refused
to
give
any
guarantee
it
would
change
its
ways
.
###
But
the
oil
ministers
continue
to
study
the
plan
,
and
it
will
probably
be
the
basis
for
discussion
at
next
month
's
meeting
.
###
It
's
understood
several
compromises
already
have
been
worked
into
the
plan
.
###
The
ceiling
would
be
lifted
to
21.5
million
barrels
to
provide
Kuwait
and
the
United
Arab
Emirates
much
higher
official
quotas
while
reducing
percentage
shares
of
some
others
.
###
Libya
's
previous
conditions
are
no
longer
considered
a
problem
,
although
the
United
Arab
Emirates
is
still
an
issue
.
###
Saudi
Arabia
,
OPEC
's
kingpin
,
also
has
surfaced
as
a
possible
obstacle
,
some
OPEC
sources
said
.
###
Insisting
on
a
24.5
%
share
of
any
ceiling
,
Saudi
officials
have
long
pressed
for
the
pro
rata
distribution
of
increases
to
all
members
.
###
In
Geneva
,
however
,
they
supported
Iran
's
proposal
because
it
would
have
left
the
Saudi
percentage
of
the
OPEC
total
intact
,
and
increased
actual
Saudi
volume
to
nearly
5.3
million
barrels
daily
from
five
million
.
###
Some
of
the
proposed
modifications
since
,
however
,
call
on
Saudi
Arabia
to
``
give
back
''
to
the
production-sharing
pool
a
token
23,000
barrels
.
###
Though
tiny
,
that
's
a
reduction
in
its
share
.
###
Mr.
Nazer
,
the
Saudi
oil
minister
,
reiterated
here
that
the
kingdom
would
insist
on
maintaining
its
percentage
share
of
OPEC
production
under
any
quota
revisions
.
###
``
Under
any
circumstances
,
Saudi
Arabia
should
get
more
''
rather
than
less
,
Mr.
Nazer
said
.
###
In
a
blow
to
France
's
Rafale
jet
fighter
,
the
French
navy
for
the
first
time
publicly
stated
its
desire
to
buy
15
McDonnell
Douglas
Corp.
F-18
Hornets
to
defend
its
aircraft
carriers
.
###
The
statement
is
likely
to
sharpen
the
debate
within
France
's
military
establishment
over
the
Rafale
,
which
is
made
by
Avions
Marcel
Dassault-Breguet
Aviation
SA
.
###
In
an
interview
in
the
navy
's
official
weekly
magazine
Cols
Bleus
,
the
navy
's
second-in-command
,
Adm.
Yves
Goupil
,
said
the
navy
still
intends
to
buy
86
Rafales
as
scheduled
in
the
late
1990s
and
early
21st
century
.
###
The
air
force
is
to
take
at
least
250
more
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
said
the
navy
ca
n't
wait
until
1998
,
when
the
naval
Rafale
becomes
available
,
to
replace
its
obsolete
fleet
of
American-made
Crusaders
,
used
since
the
1950s
to
protect
carriers
from
attack
.
###
Rather
than
renovate
the
Crusaders
,
which
Dassault
is
proposing
to
do
for
around
1.8
billion
French
francs
-LRB-
$
286.6
million
-RRB-
,
Adm.
Goupil
said
the
navy
wants
to
buy
used
F-18s
from
the
U.S.
Navy
.
###
Officially
,
the
statement
is
n't
an
attack
on
the
Rafale
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
said
that
when
the
F-18s
wear
out
,
the
navy
is
prepared
to
take
Rafales
to
replace
them
.
###
But
unofficially
,
senior
navy
officials
sharply
criticize
the
Rafale
as
an
air
force
plane
ill-suited
to
carrier
use
.
###
Although
they
never
said
so
publicly
,
they
have
made
no
secret
of
their
preference
for
the
F-18
on
operational
grounds
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
's
comments
are
likely
to
inflame
the
broader
dispute
within
the
military
establishment
here
over
the
role
of
Dassault
.
###
Although
government-controlled
,
Dassault
still
is
run
by
the
founder
's
son
,
Chairman
Serge
Dassault
,
who
has
fiercely
protected
his
company
's
independence
.
###
The
Rafale
project
is
the
result
of
France
's
inability
jointly
to
develop
a
plane
with
other
countries
,
and
French
officials
question
whether
the
state
can
continue
paying
for
expensive
independent
programs
.
###
So
far
,
Mr.
Dassault
has
resisted
pressure
to
change
.
###
What
brought
the
naval
issue
to
a
head
is
that
the
Crusaders
are
literally
falling
apart
,
without
any
immediate
plan
to
replace
them
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
,
a
former
Crusader
squadron
leader
,
said
that
the
last
other
country
to
use
Crusaders
,
the
Philippines
,
retired
its
last
ones
two
years
ago
.
###
A
French
Crusader
crash
a
few
months
ago
heightened
pressure
for
new
planes
here
.
###
Adm.
Goupil
rejected
Dassault
's
proposal
to
renovate
the
Crusaders
,
saying
the
cost
was
impossible
to
estimate
.
###
Even
modernized
,
he
said
,
the
Crusaders
represent
an
obsolete
and
dangerous
protection
for
the
aircraft
carriers
France
has
sent
to
meet
such
crises
as
the
wars
in
Lebanon
and
the
Persian
Gulf
.
###
Defense
Minister
Jean-Pierre
Chevenement
told
a
meeting
of
the
Anglo-American
Press
Association
that
the
question
of
modernizing
the
Crusaders
or
buying
used
F18s
is
a
``
political
''
decision
that
he
will
make
in
due
time
.

the

said
.
###
The

cited

###
Spending
by

in

adjusted

.
###
For
Cathay
Pacific
Airways
,
the
smooth
ride
may
be
ending
.
###
The
first
signs
of
trouble
came
last
month
when
the
Hong
Kong
carrier
,
a
subsidiary
of
Swire
Pacific
Ltd.
,
posted
a
5
%
drop
in
operating
profit
for
the
first
six
months
and
warned
that
margins
will
remain
under
pressure
for
the
rest
of
the
year
.
###
Securities
analysts
,
many
of
whom
scrapped
their
buy
recommendations
after
seeing
Cathay
's
interim
figures
,
believe
more
jolts
lie
ahead
.
###
Fuel
and
personnel
costs
are
rising
,
and
tourism
in
and
through
Hong
Kong
remains
clouded
by
China
's
turmoil
since
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
.
###
In
addition
,
delivery
delays
for
the
first
two
of
as
many
as
28
Boeing
747-400s
that
the
carrier
has
ordered
have
raised
costs
because
personnel
had
been
hired
to
man
the
planes
.
###
And
tough
competition
in
the
air-freight
market
is
cutting
into
an
important
sideline
.
###
There
also
is
concern
that
once
Hong
Kong
reverts
to
China
's
sovereignty
in
1997
,
Cathay
will
be
forced
to
play
second
fiddle
to
China
's
often-disparaged
flag
carrier
,
Civil
Aviation
Administration
of
China
,
or
CAAC
.
###
``
The
sense
is
we
would
never
be
in
a
position
again
where
everything
works
for
us
the
way
it
did
before
,
''
says
Rod
Eddington
,
Cathay
's
commercial
director
.
###
Sarah
Hall
,
an
analyst
at
James
Capel
-LRB-
Far
East
-RRB-
Ltd.
,
says
there
is
n't
much
Cathay
can
do
about
rising
costs
for
jet
fuel
,
Hong
Kong
's
tight
labor
market
,
or
the
strengthening
of
the
local
currency
,
which
is
pegged
to
the
U.S.
dollar
.
###
These
factors
are
further
complicated
by
the
airline
's
push
to
transform
itself
from
a
regional
carrier
to
an
international
one
,
Ms.
Hall
says
.
###
Ms.
Hall
expects
Cathay
's
profit
to
grow
around
13
%
annually
this
year
and
next
.
###
In
1988
,
it
earned
$
2.82
billion
Hong
Kong
-LRB-
US$
361.5
million
-RRB-
on
revenue
of
HK$
11.79
billion
.
###
Cathay
is
taking
several
steps
to
bolster
business
.
###
One
step
is
to
beef
up
its
fleet
.
###
In
addition
to
aircraft
from
Boeing
Co.
,
Cathay
announced
earlier
this
year
an
order
for
as
many
as
20
Airbus
A330-300s
.
###
The
expansion
,
which
could
cost
as
much
as
US$
5.7
billion
over
the
next
eight
years
,
will
expand
the
fleet
to
about
43
planes
by
1991
,
up
from
30
at
the
end
of
last
year
,
according
to
Sun
Hung
Kai
Securities
Ltd
.
###
The
fuel-efficient
Airbus
planes
will
be
used
largely
to
replace
Cathay
's
aging
fleet
of
Lockheed
Tristars
for
regional
flights
,
while
the
Boeing
aircraft
will
be
used
on
long-haul
routes
to
Europe
and
North
America
.
###
Cathay
also
is
moving
some
of
its
labor-intensive
data-processing
operations
outside
Hong
Kong
.
###
Fierce
bidding
for
young
employees
in
Hong
Kong
is
pushing
up
Cathay
's
labor
costs
by
20
%
a
year
for
low-level
staff
,
while
experienced
,
skilled
employees
are
leaving
the
colony
as
part
of
the
brain
drain
.
###
Some
jobs
already
have
been
moved
to
Australia
,
and
there
are
plans
to
place
others
in
Canada
.
###
David
Bell
,
a
spokesman
for
the
airline
,
says
the
move
is
partly
aimed
at
retaining
existing
staff
who
are
leaving
to
secure
foreign
passports
ahead
of
1997
.
###
Cathay
is
working
to
promote
Hong
Kong
as
a
destination
worth
visiting
on
its
own
merits
,
rather
than
just
a
stopover
.
###
Although
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
have
hurt
its
China
flights
,
Cathay
's
other
routes
have
retained
high
load
factors
.
###
Mr.
Eddington
regards
promoting
Hong
Kong
as
an
important
part
of
attracting
visitors
from
Japan
,
South
Korea
and
Taiwan
,
where
the
number
of
people
looking
to
travel
abroad
has
surged
.
###
There
also
has
been
speculation
that
Cathay
will
be
among
the
major
private-sector
participants
in
the
Hong
Kong
government
's
plans
to
build
a
new
airport
,
with
the
carrier
possibly
investing
in
its
own
terminal
.
###
Cathay
officials
decline
to
comment
on
the
speculation
.
###
Mr.
Eddington
sees
alliances
with
other
carriers
--
particularly
Cathay
's
recent
link
with
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
--
as
an
important
part
of
Cathay
's
strategy
.
###
But
he
emphasizes
that
Cathay
has
n't
any
interest
in
swapping
equity
stakes
with
the
U.S.
carrier
or
with
Lufthansa
,
the
West
German
airline
with
which
it
has
cooperated
for
about
a
decade
.
###
Analysts
believe
Cathay
is
approached
for
such
swaps
by
other
carriers
on
a
regular
basis
,
particularly
as
the
popularity
of
share
exchanges
has
grown
among
European
carriers
.
###
``
We
think
alliances
are
very
important
,
''
Mr.
Eddington
says
.
###
``
But
we
'd
rather
put
funds
into
our
own
business
rather
than
someone
else
's
.
###
I
'm
not
sure
cross-ownership
would
necessarily
make
things
smoother
.
''
###
In
a
pattern
it
aims
to
copy
in
several
key
U.S.
destinations
,
Cathay
recently
announced
plans
to
serve
San
Francisco
by
flying
into
American
Airlines
'
Los
Angeles
hub
and
routing
continuing
passengers
onto
a
flight
on
the
U.S.
carrier
.
###
``
We
'll
never
have
a
big
operation
in
the
U.S.
,
and
they
'll
never
have
one
as
big
as
us
in
the
Pacific
,
''
Mr.
Eddington
says
.
###
``
But
this
way
,
American
will
coordinate
good
extensions
to
Boston
,
New
York
,
Chicago
and
Dallas
.
###
We
'll
coordinate
on
this
end
to
places
like
Bangkok
,
Singapore
and
Manila
.
''
###
Asian
traffic
,
which
currently
accounts
for
65
%
of
Cathay
's
business
,
is
expected
to
continue
as
the
carrier
's
mainstay
.
###
Cathay
has
long
stated
its
desire
to
double
its
weekly
flights
into
China
to
14
,
and
it
is
applying
to
restart
long-canceled
flights
into
Vietnam
.
###
Further
expansion
into
southern
Europe
is
also
possible
,
says
Mr.
Bell
,
the
spokesman
.
###
While
a
large
number
of
Hong
Kong
companies
have
reincorporated
offshore
ahead
of
1997
,
such
a
move
is
n't
an
option
for
Cathay
because
it
would
jeopardize
its
landing
rights
in
Hong
Kong
.
###
And
Mr.
Eddington
emphatically
rules
out
a
move
to
London
:
``
Our
lifeblood
is
Hong
Kong
traffic
rights
.
''
###
He
says
the
airline
is
putting
its
faith
in
the
Sino-British
agreement
on
Hong
Kong
's
return
to
China
.
###
A
special
section
dealing
with
aviation
rights
states
that
landing
rights
for
Hong
Kong
's
airlines
,
which
include
the
smaller
Hong
Kong
Dragon
Airlines
,
will
continue
to
be
negotiated
by
Hong
Kong
's
government
.
###
But
critics
fret
that
post-1997
officials
ultimately
will
be
responsible
to
Beijing
.
###
``
My
feeling
is
-LCB-
Cathay
does
n't
-RCB-
have
a
hope
in
the
long
run
,
''
says
an
analyst
,
who
declines
to
be
identified
.
###
Cathay
would
love
to
keep
going
,
but
the
general
sense
is
they
're
going
to
have
to
do
something
.
''
###
Mr.
Eddington
acknowledges
that
the
carrier
will
have
to
evolve
and
adapt
to
local
changes
,
but
he
feels
that
the
Sino-British
agreement
is
firm
ground
to
build
on
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
###
``
We
're
confident
that
it
protects
our
route
structure
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
our
ability
to
grow
and
prosper
.

###
In
the
hard-hit
Marina
neighborhood
,
life
after
the
earthquake
is
often
all
too
real
,
but
sometimes
surreal
.
###
Some
scenes
:
--
Saturday
morning
,
a
resident
was
given
15
minutes
to
scurry
into
a
sagging
building
and
reclaim
what
she
could
of
her
life
's
possessions
###
Saturday
night
she
dined
in
an
emergency
shelter
on
salmon
steaks
prepared
by
chefs
from
one
of
the
city
's
four-star
restaurants
.
###
--
Mayor
Art
Agnos
stands
in
the
glare
of
television
lights
trying
to
explain
for
the
20th
time
why
the
city
is
severely
restricting
access
to
badly
damaged
structures
.
###
A
couple
in
fashionable
spandex
warm-up
suits
jogs
by
,
headphones
jauntily
in
place
,
weaving
their
way
along
a
street
of
fractured
and
fallen
houses
.
###
At
a
nearby
corner
,
they
swerve
perilously
close
to
a
listing
apartment
house
,
oblivious
to
any
danger
.
###
A
policeman
shakes
his
head
in
amazement
as
he
steers
them
away
.
###
--
A
young
woman
who
has
been
out
of
town
shows
up
at
the
Marina
Middle
School
to
learn
that
her
apartment
is
on
the
condemned
list
.
###
She
is
told
she
ca
n't
enter
unless
she
is
accompanied
by
an
inspector
.
###
She
bursts
into
tears
and
walks
away
.
###
Nearby
,
five
temporary
residents
of
the
school
shelter
sit
on
stools
,
having
their
necks
and
backs
kneaded
by
volunteer
masseuses
.
###
The
Marina
rescue
center
offered
a
very
San
Franciscan
response
to
the
disaster
.
###
In
addition
to
free
massages
,
there
was
free
counseling
,
phone
calls
and
a
free
shuttle
bus
to
a
health
club
,
which
offered
up
its
showers
,
saunas
and
hot
tubs
.
###
The
cafeteria
offered
donated
croissants
and
brie
for
breakfast
,
and
for
dinner
,
pasta
salad
and
chocolate
mousse
torts
along
with
the
salmon
.
###
``
This
has
been
a
15-pound
earthquake
for
me
,
''
said
resident
Joan
O'Shea
,
who
works
in
an
acupuncturist
's
office
.
###
She
and
some
friends
are
considering
offering
earthquake
victims
free
yoga
classes
and
``
aroma
therapy
''
--
massages
with
scented
oils
.
###
She
finds
the
response
of
Marina
residents
--
primarily
yuppies
and
elderly
people
--
to
the
devastation
of
their
homes
``
incredible
.
###
People
have
been
very
respectful
of
each
other
.
###
I
do
n't
know
if
this
would
have
happened
somewhere
else
.
''
###
Out
on
the
streets
,
some
residents
of
badly
damaged
buildings
were
allowed
a
15-minute
scavenger
hunt
through
their
possessions
.
###
``
It
's
so
weird
to
have
to
decide
what
's
really
important
to
you
,
''
said
Barbara
May
.
###
She
went
first
for
personal
mementos
.
###
In
post-earthquake
parlance
,
her
building
is
a
``
red
.
''
###
After
being
inspected
,
buildings
with
substantial
damage
were
color-coded
.
###
Green
allowed
residents
to
re-enter
;
yellow
allowed
limited
access
;
red
allowed
residents
one
last
entry
to
gather
everything
they
could
within
15
minutes
.
###
Reds
and
yellows
went
about
their
business
with
a
kind
of
measured
grimness
.
###
Some
frantically
dumped
belongings
into
pillowcases
,
others
threw
goods
out
windows
.
###
It
did
n't
help
that
on
Saturday
,
after
three
days
of
sunshine
,
it
rained
.
###
``
The
guys
are
going
for
their
skis
,
their
stereos
,
their
personal
computers
,
''
said
Frank
Fitzgerald
,
who
helped
others
empty
their
apartments
.
###
``
The
women
wanted
photo
albums
,
a
certain
brooch
,
kind
of
sentimental
things
.
''
###
He
showed
an
unbroken
,
still-ticking
pocket
watch
that
he
retrieved
for
one
woman
.
###
It
belonged
to
her
grandfather
.
###
Some
residents
defied
orders
and
returned
to
``
red
''
buildings
to
retrieve
goods
.
###
One
building
was
upgraded
to
red
status
while
people
were
taking
things
out
,
and
a
resident
who
was
n't
allowed
to
go
back
inside
called
up
the
stairs
to
his
girlfriend
,
telling
her
to
keep
sending
things
down
to
the
lobby
.
###
A
policewoman
had
to
be
called
in
to
make
her
leave
;
the
policewoman
helped
carry
out
one
last
load
.
###
Enforcement
of
restricted-entry
rules
was
sporadic
,
residents
said
.
###
One
man
trying
to
remove
his
car
was
told
by
officials
to
get
out
of
his
garage
.
###
When
he
sneaked
back
later
to
try
again
,
a
different
policeman
offered
to
help
him
get
the
car
out
.
###
The
Marina
also
has
become
the
focal
point
of
city
efforts
to
reunite
residents
with
any
pets
that
may
have
fled
or
become
lost
during
the
earthquake
.
###
On
lampposts
along
Fillmore
Street
,
a
major
Marina
artery
,
posters
were
offering
a
$
100
reward
for
a
cat
lost
during
the
quake
.
###
The
San
Francisco
Society
for
the
Prevention
of
Cruelty
to
Animals
also
has
been
providing
medical
care
,
food
,
water
and
foster
homes
for
quake-displaced
animals
.
###
The
SPCA
says
it
has
received
more
than
100
requests
for
foster
homes
on
behalf
of
dogs
and
cats
,
though
some
people
have
sought
temporary
homes
for
birds
and
fish
.
###
For
example
,
one
parakeet
owner
returning
home
found
that
her
apartment
,
like
many
others
in
the
Marina
,
did
n't
have
heat
.
###
``
She
can
stay
there
with
no
heat
,
but
for
a
parakeet
,
that
can
be
deadly
,
''
says
Daralee
Konowitch
,
animalcare
services
manager
for
the
SPCA
.
###
A
warm
foster
home
has
been
found
.
###
The
neighborhood
around
Alexander
Haagen
Co.
's
Vermont-Slauson
Shopping
Center
in
the
Watts
section
of
Los
Angeles
resembles
the
crime-ridden
,
deteriorating
sections
of
many
inner
cities
and
certainly
is
n't
the
sort
of
area
one
would
choose
to
visit
.
###
But
turn
into
the
shopping
center
's
parking
lot
,
and
one
could
be
in
the
safe
,
busy
mall
of
a
prosperous
suburb
.
###
Only
it
is
safer
,
and
busier
.
###
Over
the
past
year
there
have
been
only
one
burglary
,
three
thefts
of
or
from
autos
,
no
purse-snatchings
,
and
one
attempted
robbery
in
the
mall
,
which
opened
in
late
1981
.
###
A
shopping
center
of
similar
size
in
an
affluent
Los
Angeles
suburb
would
,
per
year
,
be
expected
to
have
eight
burglaries
,
70
thefts
of
or
from
autos
,
and
four
robberies
.
###
The
Watts
mall
has
annual
sales
of
more
than
$
350
per
leasable
square
foot
;
the
figure
for
a
comparable
suburban
shopping
center
would
be
$
200
.
###
Three
other
Haagen
shopping
centers
in
the
Watts
area
are
doing
almost
as
well
.
###
A
successful
low-crime
mall
in
a
high-crime
area
violates
the
more
typical
inner-city
pattern
,
in
which
commercial
areas
are
taken
over
by
unruly
youth
,
gangs
,
and
the
criminal
element
,
with
an
erosion
of
the
customer
base
,
development
capital
,
and
insurability
.
###
Major
regional
and
national
chain
stores
are
replaced
by
mom-and-pop
operations
offering
poorer-quality
merchandise
at
higher
prices
.
###
Along
with
the
exodus
of
shopping
opportunities
is
an
exodus
of
the
jobs
that
the
major
chains
used
to
provide
to
community
residents
.
###
Thus
there
is
even
more
to
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
than
a
good
place
to
shop
.
###
This
defensible
commercial
zone
becomes
,
for
the
residents
,
a
secure
oasis
in
a
barren
urban
landscape
,
evidence
that
community
decay
is
not
inevitable
and
that
the
gangs
are
not
invincible
.
###
The
center
improves
the
community
image
to
outsiders
as
well
,
and
may
help
to
arrest
,
or
even
reverse
,
the
exodus
of
capital
and
investment
.
###
An
additional
benefit
is
the
creation
of
jobs
.
###
This
starts
in
the
construction
phase
through
the
use
of
minority
contractors
and
local
workers
.
###
It
continues
through
the
life
of
the
center
;
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
has
created
500
permanent
private-sector
jobs
at
a
one-time
cost
in
public
funds
of
only
$
2,500
per
job
.
###
As
many
of
these
jobs
are
filled
by
local
residents
,
who
move
from
the
welfare
rolls
to
the
tax
rolls
,
the
$
2,500-per-job
public
investment
should
repay
itself
in
a
few
years
.
###
And
that
is
before
consideration
of
increased
state
and
local
revenues
from
taxes
and
fees
on
sales
,
real
estate
,
licenses
and
the
like
.
###
Profits
are
also
plowed
back
into
the
community
;
the
non-profit
Vermont-Slauson
Economic
Development
Corp.
receives
60
%
of
the
profits
from
the
Vermont-Slauson
Center
and
uses
the
money
to
provide
moderate
and
low-cost
housing
in
the
community
--
now
running
into
the
hundreds
of
units
--
as
well
as
commercial
and
industrial
development
projects
.
###
Bradford
Crowe
,
director
of
the
mayor
's
City
Economic
Development
Office
,
says
:
``
There
is
no
question
that
Vermont-Slauson
had
a
halo
effect
on
the
surrounding
neighborhood
.
###
What
had
been
a
deteriorated
area
with
nothing
but
wig
shops
and
shoe
shops
is
now
experiencing
a
major
upgrading
in
the
housing
and
commercial
stock
,
thanks
to
a
continuously
replenished
source
of
revitalization
capital
that
Vermont-Slauson
yields
.
''
###
Another
benefit
is
that
substantial
percentages
of
the
proprietors
in
these
centers
are
minority
businessmen
and
women
.
###
In
the
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
developed
by
Matanky
Realty
Group
in
Chicago
's
Third
Ward
,
opposite
the
Robert
Taylor
Homes
,
29
%
of
the
stores
to
date
have
been
leased
to
blacks
and
14
%
to
members
of
other
minority
groups
.
###
Children
from
the
community
will
have
worthier
role
models
than
the
drug
kingpins
.
###
So
what
's
the
catch
?
###
Primarily
that
putting
one
of
these
inner-city
deals
together
takes
time
,
patience
,
breadth
of
vision
and
negotiating
skills
that
not
all
developers
possess
.
###
Security
costs
are
also
quite
high
.
###
One
of
these
centers
can
involve
years
of
negotiating
with
numerous
public
agencies
,
local
political
leaders
,
and
citizen
groups
,
and
with
prospective
tenants
and
sources
of
financing
.
###
Suburban
deals
are
not
without
their
delays
and
complications
--
inner-city
deals
just
have
more
of
them
.
###
Security
at
a
typical
Haagen
inner-city
center
is
impressive
,
but
unobtrusive
.
###
The
entire
site
is
enclosed
by
a
6-to-8-foot-high
ornamental
iron
fence
with
a
small
number
of
remote-controlled
gates
.
###
Shrubs
and
flowers
give
it
a
pleasing
and
non-fortress-like
appearance
.
###
Infrared
motion
detectors
and
closed-circuit
TV
cameras
monitor
the
entire
center
;
lighting
levels
are
three
to
five
times
the
industry
standard
.
###
The
security
command
post
,
camouflaged
as
second-story
retail
space
,
has
its
own
``
crow
's
nest
''
above
the
roofs
of
the
other
buildings
,
with
a
panoramic
view
of
the
entire
center
.
###
Local
law
enforcement
is
present
in
a
sub-station
occupying
space
donated
by
the
center
.
###
These
features
are
also
used
in
Matanky
Realty
Group
's
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
.
###
Haagen
has
its
own
large
security
force
of
well-trained
and
well-paid
personnel
on
round-the-clock
duty
at
each
center
.
###
Security
is
60
%
to
70
%
of
the
common
area
charges
of
these
centers
,
vs.
an
industry
average
of
about
15
%
.
###
These
security
costs
are
kept
off-budget
because
the
centers
'
site
acquisition
,
construction
,
and
financing
costs
were
reduced
by
such
programs
as
Urban
Development
Action
Grants
,
Economic
Development
Administration
Grants
,
Community
Development
Block
Grants
,
tax-free
Industrial
Development
Bonds
,
Enterprise
Zone
tax
write-offs
,
city
infrastructure
grants
,
and
tax
increment
financing
.
###
Many
of
these
programs
no
longer
exist
,
or
have
been
severely
cut
back
.
###
However
,
since
these
centers
appear
to
pay
for
themselves
,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
state
and
local
governments
from
enacting
legislation
with
similar
provisions
.
###
Many
states
already
have
Enterprise
Zones
and
legislation
that
combines
tax
incentives
,
loans
,
and
grants
to
encourage
investment
in
depressed
areas
with
requirements
for
the
hiring
of
the
unemployed
and
minorities
.
###
These
programs
could
be
expanded
to
focus
on
funds
for
project
planning
,
identifying
sources
of
funds
,
and
for
acquiring
a
site
and
preparing
it
.
###
Combatting
crime
and
the
fear
of
it
in
inner-city
commercial
areas
should
give
Enterprise
Zones
more
success
than
most
have
enjoyed
to
date
.
###
With
many
suburban
areas
basically
overbuilt
with
shopping
centers
,
inner-city
areas
may
represent
a
major
new
untapped
market
for
investment
.
###
New
approaches
to
mall
design
and
operation
make
it
possible
to
tap
these
markets
.
###
If
the
risks
and
rewards
are
reasonable
,
developers
will
respond
.
###
Government
officials
who
wonder
how
important
it
is
for
them
to
encourage
development
in
high-risk
areas
should
visit
Vermont-Slauson
and
Grand
Boulevard
Plaza
and
decide
for
themselves
.
###
The
answer
will
be
obvious
.
###
Mr.
Titus
is
a
researcher
at
the
Justice
Department
's
National
Institute
of
Justice
.
###
ATHLONE

Dow
Chemical

said
its
Destec

unit
has
agreed
to
buy
PSE

a

in
a

of
$
12.25
a

other
conditions
,
the

acquiring

outstanding
,
the
companies
said
in
a
joint
statement
Friday
.
###
PSE

about
9.2
million

###
The
company
said
the
approximately
$
115
million
acquisition
price
includes
its
total
$
33
million
of
long-term

###
If
growth
regains
its
glamour
among
investors
,
a
sluggish
segment
of
the
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
could
show
some
flash
.
###
Some
stock
pickers
already
are
targeting
the
OTC
market
,
where
,
they
say
,
await
plenty
of
small
-
and
medium-sized
growth
stocks
.
###
Best
of
all
,
they
add
,
these
growth
issues
,
unlike
their
big
blue-chip
cousins
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
are
languishing
at
depressed
prices
.
###
Growth
stocks
will
return
to
favor
,
some
analysts
and
money
managers
think
,
because
of
the
jitters
caused
by
the
market
's
steep
slide
on
Oct.
13
,
and
because
of
the
current
swell
of
disappointing
earnings
announcements
.
###
Against
such
a
backdrop
,
companies
with
proven
track
records
of
earnings
gains
of
20
%
or
so
annually
have
extra
appeal
.
###
``
The
market
will
have
to
look
for
a
new
theme
now
and
that
theme
will
be
a
return
to
growth
,
''
declares
Mary
Farrell
,
a
PaineWebber
analyst
.
###
Among
her
OTC
picks
are
Oshkosh
B'Gosh
and
A&W
Brands
.
###
Like
many
OTC
growth
issues
,
they
have
market
values
--
as
measured
by
stock
price
times
shares
outstanding
--
of
roughly
$
100
million
to
$
500
million
.
###
Some
like
to
specialize
in
growth
companies
whose
shares
have
n't
traded
publicly
very
long
.
###
These
are
sometimes
dubbed
``
emerging
''
growth
companies
,
though
they
also
have
expanding-profit
track
records
.
###
While
many
growth
stocks
are
small
,
not
all
small
stocks
have
earnings-growth
momentum
.
###
That
's
an
important
distinction
because
some
analysts
and
brokers
,
who
perennially
predict
that
small
stocks
are
about
to
outperform
bigger
issues
,
may
use
any
spurt
in
growth
issues
to
help
them
sell
all
small
stocks
.
###
``
You
can
find
some
good
,
quality
companies
over
the
counter
,
''
but
investors
should
be
selective
,
says
John
Palicka
,
chief
portfolio
manager
at
Midco
Investors
,
a
Newark
,
N.J.
,
money
management
company
with
about
$
900
million
invested
in
growth
stocks
of
varying
sizes
.
###
Mr.
Palicka
's
picks
from
the
OTC
market
include
Legent
,
Mail
Boxes
Etc.
,
and
Payco
American
.
###
The
main
argument
for
growth
stocks
is
their
usually
superior
performance
in
a
slowing
economy
.
###
``
If
the
market
refocuses
on
earnings
,
we
should
get
better
valuations
of
growth
stocks
,
''
says
L.
Keith
Mullins
,
a
growth-stock
analyst
at
Morgan
Stanley
.
###
Eventually
,
he
believes
,
investors
will
be
willing
to
pay
higher
prices
for
companies
with
proven
track
records
of
earnings
growth
.
###
In
anticipation
of
that
shift
,
he
and
other
analysts
are
encouraging
their
clients
to
buy
such
issues
now
.
###
Understandably
,
smaller
growth
stocks
have
n't
been
in
favor
recently
.
###
The
average
issue
on
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
Index
gained
35
%
last
year
,
Ms.
Farrell
of
PaineWebber
says
.
###
Smaller-stock
earnings
,
by
comparison
,
rose
between
15
%
and
20
%
.
###
In
addition
,
earnings
growth
took
a
back
seat
to
cash
flow
,
restructuring
and
takeover
potential
,
and
breakup
value
as
the
preferred
stock-picking
standards
for
much
of
the
year
.
###
Also
,
the
smaller
growth
stocks
are
n't
widely
traded
,
and
so
are
harder
to
buy
and
sell
quickly
than
blue
chips
.
###
As
a
result
,
Morgan
Stanley
's
Index
of
40
Emerging
Growth
Stocks
--
most
of
which
are
in
the
OTC
market
--
is
up
only
13
%
for
the
year
,
while
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
has
leaped
24
%
and
the
S&P
500
has
grown
25
%
.
###
The
Nasdaq
Composite
has
gained
23
%
this
year
,
but
that
's
largely
due
to
the
100
largest
nonfinancial
stocks
,
which
have
soared
30
%
.
###
Some
investors
are
skeptical
of
growth
stocks
because
investing
in
them
means
ignoring
that
maxim
found
in
the
fine
print
of
some
investment
advertisements
--
that
past
performance
is
n't
indicative
of
future
results
.
###
``
People
are
naturally
suspicious
of
them
,
''
says
Mr.
Mullins
of
Morgan
Stanley
.
###
Among
his
favorites
in
his
firm
's
index
are
Legent
,
Silicon
Graphics
and
Novell
.
###
However
,
more
money
managers
are
reassured
that
profit
is
regaining
importance
.
###
Mark
Schoeppner
,
portfolio
manager
at
Pittsburgh-based
Quaker
Capital
Management
,
says
that
in
reaction
to
nervousness
about
debt-laden
buy-out
transactions
,
analysts
and
investors
now
appear
to
be
``
valuing
stock
based
on
future
earnings
as
opposed
to
the
amount
of
debt
the
company
can
support
.
''
###
Barney
Hallingby
,
managing
director
of
research
at
Hambrecht
&
Quist
,
also
believes
earnings
growth
is
beginning
to
play
a
greater
part
in
investors
'
buying
decisions
.
###
On
Friday
,
Hambrecht
&
Quist
added
St.
Jude
Medical
to
the
list
of
20
stocks
it
strongly
recommends
.
###
The
opinion
is
largely
based
on
the
company
's
earnings
momentum
,
Mr.
Hallingby
says
.
###
St.
Jude
's
market
value
on
Nasdaq
exceeds
$
1
billion
,
so
it
is
n't
a
small
stock
.
###
The
medical
devices
maker
's
earnings
rose
nearly
35
%
in
1987
from
1986
,
and
75
%
in
1988
.
###
Kurt
Kruger
,
who
follows
the
stock
for
Hambrecht
&
Quist
,
anticipates
that
the
company
's
net
income
will
grow
51
%
to
$
2.15
a
share
this
year
.
